    "comment": "The project proposes creating an Accountability Partner Web application for Minerva University students, aiming to match individuals with similar goals, compatible schedules, and preferred communication styles. This platform seeks to overcome issues like global distribution, ineffective group chats, and lack of structured goal tracking by providing private check-ins, progress logs, reminders, and milestone visualizations to maintain motivation and consistency.\n\nTo validate this concept, a short-term experiment involves using a Google Form for students to sign up and manually matching partners based on their responses. Participants would engage in regular check-ins and updates, with monthly assessments of their enthusiasm and success rates to determine the effectiveness of the accountability partnerships before potentially developing an automated version of the web application.",

To make them even better, mention more of the similarities and differences between the problems.\n\nHere is a summary of the main similarities and difference between the problems:\n\n1. Both problems applied abstraction. In the case of the robot, we reduced an infinite state space to a finite one. In the missionaries and cannibals problem, we reduced a state space of size 5 down to 3 by recognizing that we only needed to store the missionaries and cannibals on one bank.\n2. Both problems had constraints on movement (the maze walls and the rules of missionaries and cannibals respectively).\n\nDifferences:\n\n1. The robot states corresponded to physical quantities (position and angles) whereas the missionaries and cannibals represented the number of each on the bank and the boat position.\n2. The state-space of the robot navigation problem was naturally continuous whereas for the m & c problem, it was naturally discrete.\n3. The branching factor of each was different. With the robot navigation problem, it was usually 3 (with the previously-visited state excluded), but with the m & c problem, the most common branching factor was 1.",

    "comment": "Good job on this poll! Here are some ways to improve the answer:\n\nHow DLS Addresses: The explanation for Depth-Limited Search (DLS) is correct, but it could be clearer. DLS avoids infinite paths by introducing a depth limit, but this can result in missed solutions if the depth limit is too low. This point is important and should be emphasized more clearly.\n\nFlaw of DFS in DLS Context: The mention of \"choosing a too-low L\" is good but could clarify that this makes DLS incomplete because it could miss deeper solutions. \"Too-high L\" could also cause inefficiency but won't make the search incomplete\u2014just slower\n\nSo in essence, Expand slightly on the implications of setting depth limits in DLS (incompleteness if too low, inefficiency if too high) and emphasize the systematic nature of IDDFS in finding solutions at the correct depth.\n\nAlso, please try to be more active in class.",

In the third question, the answer is actually an utility based agent. \n\n Maximizing the score implies that the agent isn\u2019t just aiming to achieve a binary goal (like reaching a destination or completing a task), but is instead seeking to optimize its performance according to a certain criterion\u2014here, the score.\nA goal-based agent would simply aim to achieve a fixed goal, such as reaching a target score or completing a task. Once it achieves that goal, it\u2019s satisfied, regardless of how well it performed along the way.\nA utility-based agent, on the other hand, is designed to evaluate and choose actions that maximize some numerical value or \"utility,\" which, in this case, would be the score. The agent constantly looks for ways to increase its score and selects actions accordingly, making it behave in an optimization manner.\n\nGreat explanations though, however! I hope that cleared the confusion.",

If you''re interested in following it up, 1) it connects to the Markov processes we studied- I just didn't have time to get that far, but more importantly, 2) it is often used for efficiency in matrix manipulation and data storage which were beyond the scope of this class.",

I really liked the effort you put in to include sources as well.\n\nHere are the possible arguments that could be used:\n\nFOR:\n- Moral/ethical argument, to help lift people above the poverty line\n- Companies are inflexible, they cannot simply replace workers with machines when wages increase (have to keep workers on)\n- A higher minimum wage will raise labor costs. However, many companies can recoup cost increases in the form of higher prices (because most of their customers are not poor, the net effect is to transfer money from higher-income to lower-income families).\n- Higher wages = more productive workers which offsets the increasing labour costs\n- Higher pay increases workers\u2019 buying power. Because poor people spend a relatively large proportion of their income, a higher minimum wage can boost overall economic activity and stimulate economic growth, creating more jobs)\n\u200b\u200b- As many individuals working at minimum wage are reliant on government support, raising it could reduce government expenditures and help those who really need it (e.g. elderly, unable to work, etc.)\n- Some studies show that raising the minimum wage actually has no impact on employment\n- When the minimum wage is raised, businesses tend to increase prices - if most customers are richer anyway, it is essentially a transfer from wealthier to less wealthy individuals.\n\nAGAINST:\n- As per neoclassical theory, raising the minimum wage will simply result in unemployment\n- In the event that businesses don\u2019t sack workers, increasing labor costs will lead to increasing prices (inflationary pressure) \n- Companies may choose to increase mechanization, displacement of labor by machines\n- Impact of migration patterns (quality workers may leave countries with no/low minimum wage laws for countries with higher minimum wage laws)\"",

Particularly good is how an outside source is brought in to support the use of inclusion of covariates like personality, coping and professional backgrounds. Your suggestion to change the title is good, but going even further is warranted. The suggestion to enhance the replicability and rigor of their results by researching (or I would argue, including) other hospitals, is sound.",

    "comment": "This is a solid attempt, but the main part of the response should focus on why exactly the perceived luminance profile is an emergent property.  Also remember, the position of cells is not important - their activation and inhibition patterns depend on the incoming light profile. Photoreceptors of the dark parts have weak signals that are further inhibited at the level of bipolar cells, with the strongest inhibition coming from the cells processing the bright parts. The opposite is true for the bright parts. This is an emergent property because the perceived luminance profile is a property at the level of retina occurring due to interactions at other levels and is different from the sum of its parts.",

    "comment": "Good job calculating the unemployment rate correctly! You also explain what the unemployment rate is while touching upon how it can be problematic. That said, near the bottom you mention \"this rate represents the proportion of the labor force (LF) that is actively seeking employment.\" Per the question, there are 2 million people part of the LF that are seeking employment, but are not counted in this metric. You should specify \"those currently without a job who are in the labor force and actively seeking employment.\" Small, but important distinction. \n\nAdditionally, remember that while the total population minus those out of the labor force might seem like a straightforward way to calculate the labor force, it could potentially include individuals who are not part of the active labor force, leading to an inaccurate representation of the workforce. \n\nTherefore, take a look at this way of calculating the unemployment rate with the explained logic behind each calculation:\n1. Total labor force = 62 million employed + 10 million people looking for a job - 2 million people looking but employed = 70 Million people.\n\u200b2. Unemployed = 8 million people, because they not working and looking for work\n3. Unemployment rate = unemployed/total labor force = 8/70 =11.4 percent",

For example, in a dictator game, people might choose to distribute 10 euros differently between themselves and others. Each euro given to others might be interpreted differently (generosity, fairness, duty, etc.), and it would be unclear how this very specific behavior in a study setting relates to real world behavior.",

One important point to make would be to address specifically the poll on how to choose between DP and greedy algorithms beyond the concept of backtracking and could benefit from more depth or examples.\n\nJust to clarify\u2014DP doesn't backtrack in the conventional sense (like in backtracking algorithms used for solving constraint satisfaction problems). Instead, DP builds up a solution by combining the solutions of smaller subproblems which might require revisiting previously solved subproblems, which could be seen as a form of \"backtracking\" in a broader sense.\n\nNote: remember that in the final project, I will be looking for **specific examples** of where we can see optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.",

Consider delving into the specifics of calculating priority values to improve your explanation. By understanding how the utility is calculated and which variables affect it, you can boost your motivation and detect the failure modes that could be adjusted in your improvements. \nAlthough you have completed the efficiency analysis, applying this LO could be supercharged by justifying your metrics. Setting specific metrics and explaining their relevance to your task scheduler would improve your response. For example, in the experimental approach, you could introduce the input types you used in the program. In a real-life test drive, you could highlight other efficiency metrics, such as the number of completed tasks or tasks executed on time.",

    "comment": "Using #rationalchoice to explain the swift impeachment process works well. But I am not convinced that #rationalchoice is the best explanatory framework for understanding why protesters took to the streets so suddenly and in such large numbers. For that you should examine trust in institutions, which has long been quite low in S. Korea. See this study: https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/9789264308992-5-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/9789264308992-5-en\n\nThe data presented in the study is findable through library research or the World Values Survey, and more thorough research on the topic through the lens of institutionalism would have led you to such sources in your analysis. Basically what happened is that the Park scandal represented a tipping point for a public who had long perceived its governance institutions as incompetent and corrupt. You cannot understand the tipping point without a quantitative look at sentiments toward institutions prior to it.",

In contrast, for the total distance traveled, the key is that it is cumulative regardless of the direction of the travel. In other words, it is going to be the integral of the absolute value of the function.",

    "comment": "Your diagram covers important causal factors. But the visualization and the written analysis fall short in a few important regards. First, there is no clear emphasis on which factors were most significant. Your analysis mostly lists factors without making a claim as to which ones were most important. A persuasive analysis would, for instance, emphasize the importance of the evolving attitudes of the Vatican (most of the countries in the Third Wave were Catholic) The Vatican basically set itself in opposition to authoritarian regimes in 1962, which your analysis neglects to mention. This is a serious oversight and reflects a lack of thorough research. The shift by the Vatican is thoroughly explored in a key work on this subject: The Third Wave by Samuel Huntington. In that book, which is foundational on this topic, the Vatican\u2019s change is pretty convincing as a major causal factor given that so many of the countries democratizing in the Third Wave were predominantly Catholic. If the Catholic church does not support an authoritarian regime in a predominantly Catholic society, then the regime suffers a legitimacy problem, as Huntington and others note. A stronger analysis would have highlighted this as a dominant factor. And in general a richer analysis would have done more to rank order the factors. Which ones were most important? Were international pressures more consequential than internal economic factors? A way to highlight more weighty factors is to make a claim, for instance that the Vatican\u2019s shift and rising levels of education were the most important factors while other factors, like economic conditions and international pressures, shaped and accelerated the Third Wave. Strong analysis involves making claims and supporting them with relevant theories and applicable evidence. Lastly, your analysis is short on numbers. Strong political science analysis incorporates numbers. You mention economic downfall and growth of the middle class. How are those measured? And what about general economic growth that you note as contributing to the general rise of a middle class? How can that be measured? Addressing questions like these allow you to create a numerate analysis, which is more thorough.",

Here are a few aspects to take it to the next level:\n- when computing the runtime to corroborate the scaling growth expected from a theoretical analysis, you should try and run the same algorithm (for the same input) several times, since we expect the results to be sensitive to numerical noise, especially for small n.\n- consider plotting both variants of the algorithm in the same plot, for a more straightforward comparison. \n\nProblem 2: You have done a good job with the empirical analysis. To go one step further, another parameter you can study is the existence of duplicate ids vs. non-duplicates. Would we expect, for non-duplicates, for the algorithm to transition fully to merge sort? Why or why not? What about the situation when there are always two copies of the same ID?\n\n\nAnother point for you to think about is that the actual data generated (from your function in code cell 18) doesn't conform to the context of the data in the problem (grades range from 1 to 5).",

We provide more detailed skeleton code in breakouts, but the PCWbook intentionally challenges you to build from fewer #your code here cues. This deliberate shift encourages you to cultivate the crucial skill of independent code writing, which, I promise, will serve you well in more complex tasks ahead. \n\nConcerning feedback, we've offered guidance in all of the PCWbooks to help you refine your approach and with suggestions for where to look to further improve your work. Looking back at your requests for feedback, it seems that you may be referring to session 5, where OHs attendance was recommended; this was because it would be more efficient to address the issues verbally than in written format, given that we're providing feedback on ~20 PCWbooks, with extra grading, before your next class. Please continue annotating your requests, and let's navigate this learning journey collaboratively.",

I see you've also added a checker to stop once there are no swaps done in a pass through the array to improve the algorithm's efficiency. You also pass all the test cases!\nHowever, the code you provide is the bubbling-up version of bubble sort while Cormen et al provides the bubbling-down algorithm.

The grade here represents your overall performance in this particular class. I believe I correct a wrong comment or add missing parts during class so I am not going to write long comments here. If anything is missing related to your performance in class that I should communicate personally then I would write that here. \n\nA 4 is all your answers were correct and/or you asked valuable questions. There weren't any missing information  and nothing needs to be improved. \nA 3 is you mostly got it correct.

Here are some ideas of what you could have discussed here:\n\n\nDuring activity 1, we had a specific prior P(Py)=0.03 for the prevalence of Pymonia in the population. We saw that without taking the small prior of 3% (the \"base rate\") into consideration correctly using Bayes' Theorem, we might naively overestimate the posterior P(Py | test+) \u2192 commit the base-rate fallacy.\n \nDuring activity 2, the prior P(L) was not specifically defined. However, we saw that by using the updating process of Bayes' Theorem, the prior's exact value did not matter very much in terms of the final result for P(L | YNYNY). With enough compelling evidence (in the form of five test results), the importance of the prior is quickly diminished.",

    "comment": "What I like is that you go into much detail in this example.\n\nYou would need to get a little more clear on the different ways that confounds play a role in different types of studies. I agree that it is hard to replicate natural factors in experimental setting, at the same time, we can not control at all for confounds in an observational approach, and are completely reliant on the available natural settings (that will inevitably also include different levels of different types of air pollution).\n\nThis is all quite complex, the idea is that you really think these examples through and in general notice that observational studies might introduce more confounds on one hand, and be more realistic in the presence of natural factors on the other hand, in addition to other strenghts/weaknesses.",

    "comment": "The math looks good! Way to go! However, your interpretation isn't on track. A good interpretation would choose A over B cause it has less loss as you said. I believe it's a typo tho. \n\nA good interpretation can be as the following:\n\nNotice that A would be chosen. An individual with this particular utility function and distorted subjective probability weighting would prefer the sure loss of A over the risky gamble of B, even though B has a higher expected value than A. This is another aspect of the possibility effect, individuals tend to be risk-averse when there is a small chance of a large loss, even when their utility function (without probability distortion) is concave up.\n\n\nContinue to seek more practice with these calculations (e.g., the end of the Minerva guide on expected utility) as we'll be doing more next week.",

    "comment": "Your value interpretation needs a bit of attention, but real world factor that affect k is good. We can think of the parameter as being the reciprocal of the infectiousness period. Its dimension is 1/time. Thus, k = 1/5 would indicate that the infectiousness period (the time it takes to recover) is 5 days, assuming we're working in units of days. Equivalently, we can also think of this as the fraction of the infected population that will recover on any given day. It's important to notice that the dimension is 1/time where time can be any unit of time.\n\nStating that k and b are inversely related is questionable because how would the rate of recovery affect the rate of infection? Remember that both of them are rates. b can get affected by how transitive the virus is or the population density (number of people that an infected person interact with daily).",

    "comment": "I like your understanding of algorithms. However, you missed the word \"computable\". \n\nAs Balci explains, every step in an algorithm must be doable, meaning that the operation must be something that is possible to do. If this isn't true, the computer/user would get stuck on a certain step and be unable to proceed to produce the output. This property works hand-in-hand with generalizability, as we need the algorithm to be effective for a wide range of inputs and not get stuck (or crash or break) on certain steps. Examples:\nImpossible operations can be encountered in mathematics, such as division by zero or finding the square root of a negative number.",

It does seem that there are some concepts that need some further review. This indicates that you still have some room for improvement to solidify your understanding and master these HCs! You'll have the chance for more practice next semester.\nNote: because it's the end of the semester, I'm trying to be VERY efficient in the scoring, so I'm giving minimal comments.  (If you get a 4, great job! Keep doing that! I will likely not give a further comment. You can check out the document below to see examples of how students did well (and not so well) on these HCs.) Please do send an email or stop by office hours if you'd like additional feedback. \nPlease do send an email or stop by office hours if you'd like additional feedback. \nTo better understand your performance and common trends among your classmates, check out the GENERAL FEEDBACK IN THIS DOCUMENT: https://bit.ly/FAas3trends\nPREVIEW: You'll have a chance to return to this assignment and deepen your analysis in January! Perhaps some of the feedback here will be useful for this follow-up analysis. Stay tuned!",

    "comment": "Overall, this is quite readable, and your intended meaning is almost always clear. There are a lot of places where you could apply a bit more parsimony, where simpler, more straightforward sentence construction would give your words a lot more impact.\n\nYou have done a nice job varying sentence length, which is really important. However, I think you would benefit from shifting the balance more in favor of shorter sentences. Occasionally, it can be delightful to have a long, complex sentence that gallops its way across multiple clauses. But those need to be the exception. You have a lot of run-on sentences that could easily be broken apart. That will allow the reader rest. Then, you can choose very specific places where you can really let loose with your sentence structure, at the point where you really want to take the reader along on a more complex emotional journey.",

Those are your opportunity to really explain what you did and why. Without a substantive footnote, it is hard to score above a 3, at least on most of the MC HCs.",

However, note that the poll is asking how Jemisin's story is a reply to LeGuin's text rather than asking for a compare and contrast. For example, Jemisin criticizes LeGuin's idea that someone must suffer to create a utopia. Another example is how Jemisin claims that we cannot 'walk away' in order to create utopia - like LeGuin's story is suggesting.",

    "comment": "Good start here. I see that you pulled some interesting takeaways from class, but this doesn't quite show a sufficient understanding of HOW these processes work. Let's make sure to demonstrate this before jumping to pros and cons.\n \nFor the analytical approach, I want to see that you understand that this approach involves formulas and mathematical rules to arrive at exact results. It's not related to a number of \"trials\". For example, last class, we calculated the exact expected value using EV=sum(x*P(x))=-0.20 for the wheel spinner game.\n \nFor the simulation, I'm not sure I see any evidence here that you know the key elements of how it works. To show a sufficient understanding, you can describe the use of random numbers to execute a process, loops to repeat the process many times, and eventually printing the expected value as the long-run average: we summed up the total winnings and divided it by the number of iterations. Note that on your assignment, we'll be looking for a stronger connection between the simulation approach, the frequentist interpretation of probability, and the law of large numbers. Why is doing lots of trials important?",

    "comment": "Nice job completing tasks [1-2] and almost finishing the third. For the first task, your code itself is perfectly functional which is great however your pseudocode is a non-descriptive one-liner. For simple tasks such as task 1 completing them with or without pseudocode does not have a big effect however practicing the skill of writing good pseudocode can be especially helpful when you attempt more logically complex tasks. For the third task, there are still some errors left to fix. First, \"me\" and \"opponent\" should be defined in the for loop so that every time a game is completed before a new one starts the points are set to 0 again. The task description states that you should serve first so \"is_serving\" should be set to True. Nice job on picking out the error in the while loop conditional and changing the \"or\" into an \"and\". You can always come to OH or approach a PT should you have any further questions, nice job!",

You could have offered some more specifics about the spring deliverable -- what is it likely to entail, how many people is it expected to reach, etc. But perhaps those are not yet clear to the team which is fine. Your applicable HCs seem fine. Certainly #audience is key. Make sure you are thinking expansively across all cornerston e courses when identifying HCs that could be applicable. There are many more to consider. Please reach out to set up a meeting at any time if I can be of help with further feedback. I would be delighted to meet with you as a group as your work progresses, so don't hesitate to be in touch if that would be helpful. Good luck!",

For the third task, the stripplot you are to construct is supposed to model the days vs sleep time, the one you have has plotted every single variable against each other. This is because when you constructed the stripplot you passed in sleep_df as the data instead of a specific column of sleep_df. For the 4th task, I like how you acknowledged that outliers can be both negative and positive to the mean and considered that in your if statement. As always, feel free to come to OH or approach a PT if you have any questions :)",

I suggest that you re-watch the video where we debriefed this poll so that you don't miss out on these fundamental concepts. \n \nThe key is that here, it's possible to obtain a sum of 10 with a 6 (and a 4). Thus, the events can happen at the same time. They are NOT disjoint. This is important if we wanted to compute the probability of at least one of these events happening, P(A or B), because when events are not disjoint, we must use the *general* addition formula and subtract their intersection: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). In addition to reviewing the recording where we worked this out, re-read section 2.1 of the OpenIntro book to solidify these rules - they will lay the foundation for the rest of the unit!",

I would have liked to see some additional justification of why you have included each premise - for example, why do you need both premise 2 and 3?  Also, why is \"hypothetical syllogism\" listed near the biconditional in premise 2? This is simply a biconditional statement; it is not in itself a hypothetical syllogism.\nGood evaluation of why the argument is deductive. \nThe negations are correct, but some of the commentary is not clear - I'm not sure what you mean by the translation of C or not B as part of premise 2/the biconditional. A biconditional is equivalent to the negation of an exclusive or, which is interesting to note, but you are not using an exclusive or here.",

It returns correct in this case because of nuances in the number and checker code cell but you can also use math.sqrt() to get a more precise decimal square root. For the fourth task, you are correct in constructing an if statement using the '.at[]' method. I would recommend attempting to complete the rest of the workbook and coming to OH to get it checked or finish it with a PT. Good job :)",

First, there is a gap between planning an event on a draft and actually holding the event (you can think of all the tasks involved in planning the event, like contacting people, setting up decorations, organizing and preparing food, etc.). Perhaps a heuristic like means-ends or working backwards could be more effective here.\nSecond, the main idea of successive approximation is about iterating on a solution, which was not explicitly called out in the response. Finally, a strong application of #heuristics explains why the heuristic is particularly effective in a given scenario (i.e., why is this better than the other heuristics?)",

    "comment": "Nice job on getting to the last task in today's workbook! For the 4th task, I noticed you got rid of the naming errors in the code, good job! The next step would involve renaming your variables so they are more descriptive and understandable, for example 't' could be renamed as 'today' or anything that provides more context for the variable's purpose and contents. As for the last task I noticed you added a for loop that repeats len(actions) which is a nice approach. It seems you have an indentation error but beyond said error I recommend revisiting your conditionals. You need more conditionals to check for 't' and 'l', and your second conditional will always turn right by amount[2]. Sometimes you may want your snake to turn right by a different amount, this can be fixed through the usage of 'i'. As always if you have any further questions feel free to approach any PTs or come to OH, nice job!",

    "comment": "Good start; a stronger answer would have used more concepts within #networks to explain your answer. Here you could mention the structure of the network, and its density to explain how the information may spread through M23. Additionally, the use of robustness here is unclear, remember that robustness describes how the structure of a network or the flow of information on the network is impacted by changes in the network.\nFor example, We can assume that the 4th cohort is a small-world network with high robustness and density. Thus by telling only a few 4th years about the conference and to spread the message we are likely to reach the entire cohort as even if not all 4th years pass this on, the high robustness would mean that this message would still reach all the 4th years. The small-world network also means that this information would spread quickly and thus we could reach everyone interested in 3 days.",

When we add a value to a list we say we appended that value to the list not the other way around; this is important to note because instead of writing \"appends the list c to True\" we would say \"appends True to the list c\".

Thus, we may argue we have different scopes.\n\nWe can also argue that the person saw only 4 narwhals in the wild. Thus, it's a deductive argument as we are saying this *seen narwhals in the wild* have longer tusks than the *seen narwhal in the museum*. Thus, if the premises are true, then the conclusion is true.

This method will definitely increase the strength (the degree to which the conclusion is supported by the premises), but if the additional evidence is wrong or made up, the argument would become unreliable. The truth of the premises is a key ingredient of reliability. Think about ways to GET true premises not to check if it's true or not. Like credible resources or narrowing the scope.",

    "comment": "Not quite -  here you're describing the rules of the simulation and their less-complex effects. A stronger answer would have identified some of these larger unique shapes and their characteristics. For example, oscillating objects such as blinkers, or moving objects such as gliders are clear emergent properties. The gliders have features - they continuously move in a direction and maintain a 'formation' (they keep coming back to the same shape), and these characteristics cannot easily be identified by looking at the characteristics of individual cells. It is technically possible to infer everything on the macro level from a close analysis of individual cells, but no individual cell is 'ever expanding' or 'constantly moving' but on the level of cell-grouping, or even the entire grid, we have these emergent phenomena. We name the property when we call it a 'glider' - a 'moving' object.",

It can be helpful to watch the video before and after the comment to remind yourself of what the question was/what the discussion was about, what you said, and how your comment was either built upon by me or subsequent students or corrected by me or subsequent students. And a quick note on grading: 3s will be very common in video scores- this is great! There are many ways to show an even deeper understanding of a concept in a short oral comment in class; for example, by very clearly and rigorously analyzing the example at hand using a tool learned before class, by offering a correction to another student\u2019s misunderstanding in a thoughtful, constructive way, etc. As always, let me know if you have questions about the topic, the grading, or your participation in class.",

For future workbooks it is important you manage your time well enough to complete all tasks, I have written a set of instructions to help you with this for future workbooks:\n1.you could look through the workbook's length at the very start and assign a rough time slot for each task to ensure you stay on track.\n2. if you get stuck on a question you can raise your hand and ask for a peer tutor's assistance or temporarily skip it and come back to it at the end to save as much time as possible.\nBesides that you did a good job at answering the questions, Although I noticed in the 7th task you answered that \"type(4/4)\" will return \"int\". In reality it returns float, since in python when the division is carried out with one division symbol it is called float division and will always return a float even if the value of the result itself could be represented with an integer.\n\nWe recommend that you finish the workbook in your free time as a lot of the knowledge here is essential for being able to complete future work in CS50B and FA with no problems. Once you have finished the workbook you can approach a peer tutor during office hours to ask questions, check your work, and clear up any confusions should there be any.",

Since both columns are stored in the index, the database can retrieve results without accessing the main table. Overall, this would improve query performance by reducing I/O operations.",

        "comment": "Great job covering the key impacts of vocabulary size and optimization techniques. To enhance your answer, you could provide specific examples or elaborate on how each optimization method benefits the model.\n\n\nModel Answer\n-----------\nA larger vocabulary enhances a model\u2019s expressiveness and its ability to capture language nuances, but it also increases memory usage and computational costs, potentially leading to sparse embeddings for rare words. Conversely, a smaller vocabulary reduces complexity and speeds up training, but may result in higher out-of-vocabulary rates and limit the model\u2019s generalization capabilities. To optimize vocabulary creation, techniques like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) used by GPT-2 can be employed to use subword tokenization, which balances coverage and efficiency. Additionally, pruning rare words and analyzing frequency distributions can help maintain a compact vocabulary without sacrificing performance.",

Queries determine what information each token is seeking, keys represent how each token can provide information, and values hold the actual content to be aggregated. If the same transformation were used for both queries and keys, the attention scores would rely solely on the similarity between tokens, making the mechanism symmetric. This would limit the model's ability to capture nuanced, asymmetric relationships and reduce its capacity to learn complex dependencies between tokens, ultimately weakening the effectiveness of the attention mechanism.",

This is relevant becausedifficulties during tracheal intubations often lead to anesthetic-related morality and morbidity, and intubating thetracheas of obese patients is often more difficult (Brodsky et al., 2002). Research questions that may beanswerable using this dataset include: 1. Is the AWS Pentaz Video method significantly more effective than theStandard Macintosh method for orotracheal intubation in obese adults? 2. What is the expected number ofintubation attempts before the procedure is effective? 3. What is the expected total intubation time? 4. Whatrate of complications (bleeding, sore throat etc.) can be expected using each intubation method?The data has 99 rows (one for each patient) and 22 columns (one for each variable)The primary treatment variable, which is identifiable because it is randomly assigned to only a subset of thetotal patients, is whether patients were treated with a standard (\u2018control\u2019) Macintosh laryngoscope with a #4blade or a more advanced (\u2018treatment\u2019) video laryngoscope.

Please refer to thisresource as: Amy S. Nowacki, 'Laryngoscope Dataset', TSHSResources Portal (2017). Available athttps://www.causeweb.org/tshs/laryngoscope/.Difficult and failed tracheal intubations are among the principalcauses of anesthetic-related mortality and morbidity. Because agood laryngeal view facilitates successful tracheal intubation,new technologies have been introduced to improve visualization.Video laryngoscopes, for example, often use miniature cameras tofacilitate visualization of the laryngeal inlet with no need toalign the oral, pharyngeal, and tracheal axes.The Pentax AWS is a novel video laryngoscope, available in Japansince 2006, which is designed to facilitate intubation byproviding a video image of the glottis. It incorporates aminiature video camera and a battery-powered, built-in LCDmonitor. A disposable blade is attached to the base system.Incorporation of an LCD display makes it possible to view theglottis simultaneously with insertion of the endotracheal tube(ETT). In this regard, it differs from some other videolaryngoscope designs that use external monitors. The Pentax AWSalso differs in having a side channel that positions and guidesthe ETT. Reports suggest that the Pentax AWS can help intubate,but randomized data remain sparse.cr This study tested thehypothesis that intubation with the Pentax AWS would be easierandfaster than with a standard Macintosh laryngoscope with a #4blade._S_o_u_r_c_e:These are data from a study by Abdallah et al.

        "comment": "You did a great job explaining how DRL enhances adaptability, reasoning, and reward-driven learning. To make your answer even stronger, you could provide specific examples or further detail on each advantage.\n\nModel Answer\n-----------\nDeepSeek R1 uses DRL instead of supervised learning because DRL enables the model to interact with its environment, using trial and error and reward signals to optimize decisions over time. This approach enhances adaptability to unseen situations and changing contexts without the need for extensive labeled datasets. DRL supports long-term reasoning and planning by optimizing sequences of actions to achieve goals, such as providing detailed proofs for math problems. Additionally, reward-driven learning allows for dynamic fine-tuning based on feedback, leading to responses that better align with human preferences and logical processes. Overall, DRL makes DeepSeek R1 more flexible, context-aware, and capable of complex, multi-step reasoning.",

The remaining variables referring to the condition of the procedures areconsistent across groups. The impact mentioned is measured and controlled through 22variables, presenting a sample size of 99 individuals.Among the variables involved are demographics, BMI, risk assessments, intubationattempts, and complications of the procedures, to mention a few. But focusing on the ones mostrelevant for the hypothesis under analysis, the most relevant outcome measures are ease andtotal time of intubation, as easiness and speed of intubation are central to comparing bothmethods under study. Looking further into how we can characterize these relevant outcomes,ease is a dependent variable ranging from 0 to 100, representing an extremely easy and difficultincubation. This measurement is based on the Cormack-Lehane grading system, a Likert scale,meaning this is a quantitative discrete variable. Also, we must consider it as a proxy that relieson multiple other measurements during the procedure that reflect the complications during theintervention. The total time of intubation variable is also a dependent variable and it can beconsidered quantitive discrete as well since it is measured in seconds and does not account forthe spectrum of milliseconds between the units being measured\",\"ranges\":[{\"start\":\"/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/span[9]\",\"startOffset\":22,\"end\":\"/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/span[27]\",\"endOffset\":61}],\"user\":11915,\"consumer\":\"speedgrader\",\"sortKey\":130,\"annotationData\":{}}",

You definitely point out some of the important primary treatment and outcome variables, but you didn't include all the necessary ones. You also didn't label them as \"treatment\" and \"outcome\" variables clearly. Here is what a model answer could look like:\n\n\"The treatment variable is \u2018Randomization\u2019, which is either 0, representing the use of the Standard Macintosh #4 (the control group), or 1, representing the use of the AWS Pentax Video (the treatment group).\n\nThe stated hypothesis measures whether the use of a different tool would be easier and faster. We will therefore assume that the primary outcome variables are:\na. ease, measuring the ease of tracheal intubation on a scale of 0-100,\nb. total_intubation_time, measuring the total intubation time in seconds which ranges from 9-100, and\nc. intubation_overall_S_F, a dummy variable which records the success of intubation where 0 = no and 1 =yes.\"",

        "comment": "Good explanation of Q-learning and PPO. To improve, you could include more details on why each method is specifically suited to their respective scenarios.\n\n\nModel Answer\n-----------\nIn class, we used Q-learning, which is an off-policy, model-free algorithm that relies on Q-values to evaluate expected rewards for discrete actions. This method is well-suited for simpler environments like grid-world navigation where actions are limited and clearly defined. On the other hand, in the PCW scenario, such as the lunar lander project, we employed PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization). PPO is an on-policy, policy-based approach that directly learns the probability distribution of actions, making it ideal for complex and continuous control tasks. The choice of PPO for the lunar lander was due to its ability to handle multi-dimensional spaces and provide more stable training through controlled policy updates, which are essential for tasks that require fine-tuned adjustments like landing a spacecraft.",

        "comment": "**Summary**\n\n**Business Idea - MotivePath:**  \nMotivePath is a gamified web application designed to support college students and early-career professionals in their job search by addressing burnout and isolation. It offers adaptive goal setting tailored to the user\u2019s industry and experience, visual progress tracking through interactive dashboards, motivational rewards such as AI feedback and virtual coaching, and community accountability via small support groups. These features work together to provide structure, motivation, and a sense of community, transforming the often demoralizing job application process into a more engaging and supportive experience.\n\n**Experiment:**  \nTo validate MotivePath, an eight-question survey was conducted among Minerva University students and early-career professionals, receiving 21 responses. The survey confirmed that the target users face significant challenges like frequent rejections, balancing job applications with other commitments, and feeling isolated during their job search. Additionally, the respondents expressed a strong preference for features such as AI-powered resume feedback, visual progress tracking, and community accountability squads, thereby supporting the core functionalities proposed for MotivePath. Despite some potential biases due to the sample size and demographic, the findings indicated a clear need for a tool like MotivePath.",

        "comment": "Great job! You clearly explained what convergence means and effectively described how the Adam optimizer facilitates achieving it.\n\n\nModel Answer\n-----------\nA model is considered to have converged when its training and validation losses stabilize, showing no significant decrease with additional training epochs. This indicates that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the data and further training is unlikely to improve its performance.\n\nOne effective method to achieve convergence is using the Adam optimizer. Adam combines the advantages of both momentum and adaptive learning rates by adjusting the step size for each parameter based on past gradients. This approach helps the model navigate complex loss landscapes more efficiently, avoids getting trapped in local minima, and accelerates the convergence process, ensuring that the model reaches a stable state more quickly and reliably.",

There's a difference. I interpret you as saying that the point is a semantic one (phrasing, not meaning) and I'm saying that the umbrella is the remedy b/c that's what you decided was the remedy. Indeed, you hopefully decided that previously in a causal way (as we discussed toward the end of the conversation -- namely that any \"pure\" prediction problem only derives its 'purity' from a preceding causal problem).",

Those two acronyms are being included without a clear pathway of how they would improve the model. Sure, if you are voting on something, QV will have the advantage of allowing the expression of preferences intensity - but would you ask borrowers to vote on reducing loan rates (they will all just say \"yes please\")? The QF is totally abstract here: which community is contributing funds? and how would this attract more funds?\n\nOn the other hand, I really appreciated the suggestions on the two paragraphs that followed (CRFs and voting rights granted through participation). These are more flashed out and connected to the organization's reality.",

The spatial scale aspects were also nice, though I think could have been further improved by showing the reader where they were first found and how they have spread from there. Moreover, this section asked for a figure that documented the spatial AND temporal scales of the disturbance and I only saw a figure for spatial scales. This certainly met standard, but the lack of a figure for the temporal scale weakened the application a bit.",

That said, much of this was a bit descriptive. Which species declined in spain? Also the idea of resilience is that, once disturbed, the community in question can \"recover\". You hint at that with this idea of birds and mammals adjusting what they eat, but you didn't document that they experienced an impact and are now recovering. Also, if the community shifts in composition it seems like it is moving into (possibly) a new alternative stable state. This just didn't come together in a clear, coherent way.",

To further enhance your explanation, please note that the three WID values come from the same distribution but are calculated using different levels of granularity (deciles vs. percentiles), which explains why the percentile-based Gini is higher. Additionally, WID combines tax data and household surveys, whereas the World Bank relies mainly on household surveys, which tend to underrepresent top incomes. This further explains why the World Bank Gini is lower.",

In contrast, specialist species that have narrow distributions may be susceptible to more population limiting factors (both density-dependent and independent) and are therefore found at lower densities throughout their narrow range.",

Seems like this data set is tractable for the classifiers, but the time-series models get a bit confused (TSF being an exception, which makes sense since it will fail over into just being a simple forest classifier if it doesn't find any temporal structure). Hope this analysis gave some insight into the patterns of mood over time! \n\nYou'd been getting stronger and stronger in the second half of the class, I really enjoyed your responses and could usually count on you for a strong answer. I think that's quite exceptional since the second half of the class is quite difficult. Great work here and hope you have a wonderful summer!",

First, its focus on an underrepresented language in digital handwriting recognition technology stands out. This emphasis notonly addresses a technological gap but also carries significant cultural and educational implications, underscoring the importance of preserving and supportingminority languages in the digital age. Second, the project's comprehensive approach to both recognition and generation of handwritten text showcases an ambitionto not only understand but also to innovate within the field of computational linguistics. Lastly, the detailed methodology and clear planning provide a strongfoundation for successful project execution, demonstrating Bas's deep understanding of the technical challenges and the structured approach required to overcomethem.My top three pieces of actionable feedback are as follows:Expand on Data Diversity and Quality Control: Given the variability in handwriting, it's crucial to detail strategies for ensuring the diversity of the collected dataset andmaintaining high data quality, especially in a crowdsourced environment. This could include the use of data preprocessing techniques and the establishment ofguidelines for contributors.Detail Evaluation Metrics: While the proposal outlines evaluation plans, specifying which metrics (such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score) will be used toassess model performance could provide clearer objectives and success benchmarks. Additionally, discussing how these metrics align with the project's goalswould offer insight into the anticipated impact of the research.Consider\",\"ranges\":[{\"start\":\"/div[1]/div[2]/div[2]/span[17]\",\"startOffset\":1,\"end\":\"/div[1]/div[2]/div[2]/span[33]\",\"endOffset\":9}],\"user\":595,\"consumer\":\"speedgrader\",\"sortKey\":227,\"annotationData\":{}}",

        "comment": "For Question 2, your explanation about Laplace's Equation modeling steady-state conditions in various fields like electrostatics and fluid dynamics is well laid out. You clearly understand how it's a special case of the Heat Equation when there's no time variation, illustrating a solid grasp of its application in steady-state scenarios.\nIn response to Question 3, you've correctly identified that solutions for any integer n, including negative and rational values, can be valid. \nFor Question 4, your methodical approach to solving Laplace's Equation using separation of variables in polar coordinates is excellent. You've correctly transformed the equation, assumed a separable solution, and detailed the steps to solve both the radial and angular parts of the equation. Your explanation aligns well with the principles of solving PDEs and applying boundary conditions to find specific coefficients. However, there seems to be a small oversight in the final construction of the solution. For the given boundary conditions with n=2 and B_2=3/2 (to maintain consistency with the normalization of the sine function), the final solution should indeed focus on the term involving sin(2*theta), but remember that the coefficient calculation is crucial and should result in B_2=3/2 for a correct match to the boundary condition f(theta)=3sin(2*theta), leading to U(r, theta)=3/2 * r^2 * sin(2*theta).",

This comparison should have plausible experimental logic: what patterns of data do you expect to see and why?\n-If you've made substantial changes to your approach, the new direction should be discussed in some detail.\n\n#MLFlexibility-->\n-Introduction of models from outside the scope of our current classes. This means reaching beyond deep neural nets, the general linear model, and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.",

This works if k divides 1 perfectly, but it would create issues otherwise. For example, if k = 0.11, then 1/0.11 = 9.09090. Converting that to an int would say N = 9, but N*k = 0.99 and not 1.0! It may seem small, but that is something we have to be careful in this analysis.",

However, many companies can recoup cost increases in the form of higher prices (because most of their customers are not poor, the net effect is to transfer money from higher-income to lower-income families).\n- Higher wages = more productive workers which offsets the increasing labour costs\n- Higher pay increases workers\u2019 buying power. Because poor people spend a relatively large proportion of their income, a higher minimum wage can boost overall economic activity and stimulate economic growth, creating more jobs)\n\u200b\u200b- As many individuals working at minimum wage are reliant on government support, raising it could reduce government expenditures and help those who really need it (e.g. elderly, unable to work, etc.)\n- Some studies show that raising the minimum wage actually has no impact on employment\n- When the minimum wage is raised, businesses tend to increase prices - if most customers are richer anyway, it is essentially a transfer from wealthier to less wealthy individuals.\n\nAGAINST:\n- As per neoclassical theory, raising the minimum wage will simply result in unemployment\n- In the event that businesses don\u2019t sack workers, increasing labor costs will lead to increasing prices (inflationary pressure) \n- Companies may choose to increase mechanization, displacement of labor by machines\n- Impact of migration patterns (quality workers may leave countries with no/low minimum wage laws for countries with higher minimum wage laws)\"",

This is fine when your data can be reduced with linear transformations, but if you have more complex data, an autoencoder with its nonlinear activation functions can encode nonlinear relationships as well. Both have the goal of reconstructing the data. CNNs have a different goal: identify high level features of your data to perform a classification type task. \n\nCNNs are a supervised technique.

        "comment": "This is a great analysis. I think you did an awesome job carefully following the assignment outline. This helped in characterizing your data and in fitting your models later. You compared a couple of models, and used an interesting data set that required some novel pre-processing.\n\nI'd like to see this extended with some data augmentation and new models in the second round. The current concern is that you probably need closer to 10^3 samples/class. Since you started with 3-4 sentiments and you might want to expand that you'll probably need a pretty large set all in. You might be able to get there by that's probably possible by chopping up your samples, using generative AI to paraphrase etc. \n\nYou might also take a look at training generative models (such as RNNs) to try generating new calendar entries in your voice for assignment 2 or 3. \n\nGreat start! Looking forward to round 2.",

        "comment": "Overall Comment: \nGenerally great work a lot of interesting outings here and much to build on. Here was how I generally evaluated each section:\n1: Missing or gibberish, 2: Obvious mistakes or partially incomplete, 3: Meets expectations, no mistakes or only a few minor quibbles, 4: Above expectation, especially thorough or in depth. 5: I only give these at the end of the semester for especially exceptional work that's been built on and revised multiple times. \n\n#MLExplaination:\n-Needs a clear description of the specific pipeline you're planning. \n-This should include methodological details (what data did you use? how was it preprocessed and split? What models, how were they fit? What were the metrics & visualizations), results/expectations (what patterns did you expect to find and what did you actually find? why was this data appropriate for finding these results? What went wrong?) and justifications for choices at each step (why did you choose these models?) \n-These explanations should refer to specific details of the pipeline and data. For example \"I chose this because it's a good classifier that's used in industry\" is a bad justification \"I chose this because I'm doing multinomial classification and it's the only non-binary classifier we covered in class\" is a great justification. \n\n#MLCode: \n-Working, well commented code that I can follow with clear outputs and models that match your expectation.\n-appropriate performance based on expectations with no obvious problems such as unbalanced data sets.\n-Nice/bonus credit: Models, metrics, or algorithms written from scratch. \n\n#MLMath:\n-For models, metrics, or algorithms you *didn't* write from scratch, include type-set, coherent equations that explain the underlying operations of the models you employ. \n\n#MLFlexibility:\n-Any methods that stretch substantially outside of the models or techniques covered in class. This includes greater depth (for instance, writing code/math from scratch). \n\n\nCommon quibbles (all of these are easy to address in assignment 2!): \nNot enough/inappropriate data: You'll generally need thousands of samples to fit robust models. Note that you'll often get artificially *high* performance with small data sets, not *low* because your models will overfit and memorize your under-constraining data sets. Use data augmentation, re-sampling or just get more!\n\nNot enough comparisons: No performance metric is meaningful if it's not compared to a different condition. Compare across multiple data sets or different models to make your point. \n\nNot enough figures/no reorganization around the #audience: Pretty often students bash around to get their notebook working and then when it finally runs they dump it in the turn in slot so they don't have to think about it any more. This artificially lowers scores! Clean it up! Add more visualizations, reorganize the text to explain your pipeline more clearly! Give it to someone else to read. Remember the point is to show someone else (i.e., your prof.) that you know what you're doing.",

        "comment": "Your project on simulating sustainable investment strategies in renewable energy is ambitious and could provide valuable insights into complex market dynamics. It's great to see you're considering a range of factors, from energy prices to technology and policy changes. The collaboration with Professor Tambasco and his emphasis on adaptive algorithms and realistic modeling of investor behavior will be crucial to the success of your simulation.\nHere are a couple of recommendations:\n- Engage with behavioral economists to deepen the understanding of investor decision-making beyond traditional financial metrics. This could provide a richer context for your models.\n- Look into gamification of your simulation model to encourage engagement from a broader audience, potentially crowdsourcing innovative investment strategies.\n- Explore the potential of blockchain technology to track and validate the sustainability impact of investments, which could add a layer of credibility and attract blockchain-savvy investors.",

        "comment": "Your response shows a thorough understanding of Naive Bayes, especially in SMS spam/ham classification. The way you explain prior, conditional probabilities, and the joint probability score is detailed and insightful.\n\nSome of the great responses from class:\n\n@Paul\nIt is a very fast method for (text) classification. It is called naive because it assumes that word order does not wrong, which is quite a strong assumption and not correct but despite this it can produce good results. Naive Bayes is based on the Bayes Theorem and conditional probabilities. First a prior probability for each class gets calculated based on the total occurances of that class in the training material and then a probability for each word gets calculated for each class. When you classify a new document, you multiply the prior with the word probability given that class and pick max.\n\n@Miray\nNaive Bayes method depends on utilizing the Bayes' theorem, which describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event, to do classification for an event with a set of classes. For instance, in SMS spam/ham classification, it sets up prior probabilities and distributions for spam and ham from the training dataset, gets the conditional probabilities of each class, and creates a joint probability score for each new prediction. It's called \"naive\" because it assumes the features in a dataset are mutually independent, which doesn't hold all the time.\n\n@Fady\nNaive Bayes is a probabilistic ML classifier using Bayes' theorem with the naive assumption that features are independent within a class label. It's usually effective for large datasets and performs mostly well for text classification despite the simplicity of assumptions.\nWe calculate the likelihood of the data for each class and multiply it by the prior probability of this class. This normalizes the result to get the posterior updated probability. the class with the highest posterior is the predicted outcome. \nThe NB balances performance and efficiency well when variables are independent.\n\n@Amos\nNaive bayes is a classification method that treats each feature independently. Mathematically, we start with a prior probability of belonging to a specific class c_i, and then to find the probability that a set of features belongs to a class, we multiply the prior by the conditional prob of the feature_j given it is a member of c_i. In the context of spam, our two classes are spam and ham, and our set of features are the words. The conditional probability for a word in spam/ham becomes the relative frequency of the word appearing in spam/ham (or in pcw the tf-idf)",

        "comment": "This was a solid answer, but I had some difficulty identifying either what the actual method being proposed was or how that method might be implemented to have the desired effect.\n\nThis is a good example of a flexibility question. I was looking for 3 major things: 1 a plausible improvement, 2 a mathematical framework that was sufficient to explain how to implement the improvement, and 3: a discussion of the necessary features of the data. \n\nHere are a few examples I really enjoyed from both classes.\n@Amos\nWhile increasing the max-depth of a tree makes us have more pure leaves, it also makes the tree more prone to overfit to the data by focusing too much on the specific features of the sample. Pruning and combining multiple trees into a forest are two ways to help prevent overfitting. Pruning is when you perform the splits to make the tree, then you remove some of the last few splits and combine their leaves to reduce the depth. The forest method combines multiple trees and trains them on different subsets or introduces some randomness and then takes the average result from multiple trees.\n\n@Etoile\nA major issue with creating classification trees is their sensitivity to perturbations, or small differences in data. Thus, small changes to a dataset can lead to a tree that looks very different to another. One proposed improvement is analogous to the idea that more samples leads to a more stable/accurate prediction. This can be done by creating many trees, and taking a combination of trees that is applicable for variations in sampled data. Additionally, we can define a max split parameter to ensure that we do not overfit the data.\n\nPast class response:\n@Evgeniia\n1. Increasing the depth of the tree: This allows for more complex decision boundaries, which can result in better classification accuracy.\n2. Increasing the number of features considered at each split: This can help capture more of the underlying relationships in the data, leading to better classification.\n3. Using other measures of impurity: Other than Gini impurity, information gain or entropy can be used to determine the quality of a split.\n4. Using ensemble methods: Techniques such as bagging and boosting can be used to combine multiple decision trees and improve classification accuracy.",

        "comment": "Good work.\n\nFor stat question 1, look at Slack for further explanation. The correct answer is achieved using arrangement.\nFor stat question 2:\n1. We want to know P(A|R). To do this, we can use Bayes\u2019 rule:\nP(A|R) = P(R|A)*P(A) / P(R)\nP(R|A) = 12/15 since we have 12 red balls in urn A\nP(A) = \u00bd assuming that there is an equal chance of us receiving each urn\nP(R) = P(R|A) * P(A) + P(R|B) * P(B), P(R|B) = 6/15, P(B) = \u00bd using the logic above\nP(R) = 12/15 * \u00bd + 6/15 * \u00bd = 0.6\n\nTherefore, P(A|R) = (12/15 * \u00bd) / (0.6) = 0.67\nThis is the posterior probability (our new belief) that the urn is A given that we took out a red ball.\n\n2. We want to know the probability of drawing another red ball (assuming that we already drew one red ball) if we use the same urn. To do this, we need to consider both cases \u2013 if the urn was A and if the urn was B. In our previous calculation, we saw that the probability that the urn is A is 0.67, which means that the probability that the urn is B is 0.33. Now, we just need to weigh these by the probability of getting a red ball in each of the urns. For urn A, it\u2019s 11/14 (we decrease the values by 1 since we assume that we already took out one red ball); for urn B, it\u2019s 5/14\nTherefore, P(second ball is red) = P(A|R) * P(second ball is from A) + P(B|R) * P(second ball is from B)\nP(second ball is red) = 0.67 * 11/14 + 0.33 * 5/14 = 0.64",

The thing is: that leisure time is NOT what makes us human, for him, instead WORK is what makes us human and distinct from animals (so you'd need to address that assumption). The bigger point for Marx is that, though there might be some people who can enjoy their leisure time, there are many who cannot and who do NOT have the choice Alex has here. \n\nIn other words, I think your point should be this: \"Marx generalizes too quickly to ONLY look at negative cases of capitalism from the workers' side; he overlooks the extent to which some people can have autonomy and happiness...\" But you need to avoid making your own claims generalizations--sure, some people have this freedom, but others don't.",

(you could mention alienation)\n\nThink about the first sentence. Does the idea that a worker's labor can be evaluated in terms of money/product already mean that she is commodified? Maybe the 'sink' here does not only refer to the fact that the worker loses value over time, but that she is evaluated as a commodity in the first place.\n\nThink about Marx's context vs ours: are there differences in contemporary context that change the application of Marx's thought to today? (internet, globalization etc) How?",

I can see that you have thoughtfully reflected on your experiences in the three Rounds of projects this semester, your interests, passions, and priorities, and your working style.\n\nVery cool to see you focus on a project that\u2019s both interesting and can yield amazing insights. Like we discussed in class, it\u2019s always an interesting tradeoff to pursue a passion project vs a project that can show your skills/help get a job after graduation\u2026.naturally ideal if your project can achieve both objectives!!\n\nNOTE: Because it's the end of the semester, grading and comments will be kept VERY brief. Please stop by Spring office hours if you\u2019d like to discuss your project or this feedback further.\n\nThank you for your thoughtful engagement in the capstone process this semester. It was great to have you in class, and I hope that you'll keep in touch! I can't wait to see what you create for your capstone next year!",

Some other interesting questions that could have been attempted would be the relationship between certain variables (such as p/e ratio and the behavior of the different investing strategies, is there any trend? It seems Value investing works best under high PE Ratio, but what type of relationship is that? I understand Theoretical Analysis of an extremely complicated system is challenging.",

Just checking how much ELBO improved would have been enough. Plus if you needed a predictive power check why do you need them and instead why didn't you use LOO? Finally you didn't answer how much improvement is achieved across models and approximation methods.",

The grade here represents your overall performance in this particular class. I believe I correct a wrong comment or add missing parts during class so I am not going to write long comments here. If anything is missing related to your performance in class that I should communicate personally then I would write that here. \n\nA 4 is all your answers were correct and/or you asked valuable questions. There weren't any missing information  and nothing needs to be improved. \nA 3 is you mostly got it correct. No major mistakes in your answers and/or your questions were relevant. \nA 2 is you were mostly incorrect and it is clear that you need to do a major review of the class material. OR you were mentally away from class, did not participate and showed no sign of preparation. \nA 1 is you were in class but did not raise your hand or ask any questions so I had to cold-call you, and even then you refused to answer. In this case, I don't have any data to evaluate. Please, don't leave me in this situation.",

Your main deduction from the chief reasons (closest to the conclusion) and the conclusion is done SO well. And, generally, you are very solid in ensuring that a premise like \"if x then y,\" pairs with \"x\" and then concludes \"so y.\" Yay!\n\nI do have a few questions, though, and some things are unclear logically: \n\n(1) I don't see how L and M support K...can you think more about this and see if you agree with me?\n\n(2) Overall, I'm struggling with that middle argument (L, M, all the way down to A). I think you contradict yourself in a few ways: \n(a) first of all, you say memory underlies psych continuity, but then you seem to claim that there are scenarios where there IS psych continuity yet NOT memory continuity...do you see why that's a problem, logically? (it suggests that memory does NOT underlie psych continuity). \n(b) I don't see how you can support K--you state that those are cases where there is psych continuity, but--if the memories aren't there--then how is there psych continuity?\n(c) the problem with (b) is that you are assuming precisely what you need to show: that there CAN be such cases. You need examples, either real or hypothetical, to make that convincing. \n\n(3) one big thing: I don't get what the relationship between memory and psych continuity is in your argument since you seem inconsistent. Is it a part of it? Does it underlie it? Are they the same? etc. \n\n(4) I don't think K supports I...I think it must work together WITH I and J, right?\n\n(5) You're missing a premise in the N and Q relationship: you need a premise that says \"memories can result in differing perceptions of oneself.\"",

These are time series data fluctuating between two different extremes. Normal distribution, on the other hand, has light tails, which means extreme values are assigned very small probabilities. However, in real-life scenarios (such as financial crises that are these time series data you are talking about), extreme values can still happen. Therefore, to use Normal distribution in these scenarios, the modeling will be off. We have t-distribution which has similar properties with Normal distribution, yet much heavier tails --> allow extreme cases to have more likelihood.",

The limits of integration are still correct though since those do depend on the data (since the likelihood function is 0 outside these limits and 1/s^26 within the limits).",

Isn't it the case that they just need to establish whether or not surveying online is cost-effective and informative? if it is both these things, then they will do it, right?

However, there is a problem with the code which affects your #CompTools grade.\n\nYour code currently works only if s = 30 (the number of samples generated) because of a bug. You should generate s samples from the Binomial and then use each of those samples to generate 1 sample from the Hypergeometric distribution. Instead, you create s Hypergeometric distributions and then evaluate the PMF for each value of x in your bar plot.\n\nIf you want to go the PMF route, you should instead compute the average over all s Hypergeometric PMFs to get the final PMF, which is shown in the bar chart and used to compute the p-value.\n\nFurthermore, the simulation only works if the sample from the Binomial(100000, 1/300) distribution for the number of typos is at least 305 \u2014\u00a0otherwise, there are not enough typos available for Sho to find 297 and Haruna to find 312.",

        "comment": "Good work.\n\nQ.1. To find all the possible vectors that can give us an orthonormal basis, we can initialize it as an unknown vector, say, <a,b,c>, and solve the system of linear equations. We know that 1/sqrt(3)*a-1/sqrt(3)*b+1/sqrt(3)*c=0 and 0-1/sqrt(2)*b-1/sqrt(2)*c=0. Solving these two together gives us b=-c and a=-2c. And we know that the norm of the new vector needs to be 1, so sqrt(a^2+b^2+c^2)=1. Putting everything together, we'll get c=\u00b11/sqrt(6). Therefore, our answers are: {<-2/sqrt(6),-1/sqrt(6),1/sqrt(6)>, <2/sqrt(6),1/sqrt(6),-1/sqrt(6)>}. We can see that the solution is not unique.\n\nQ.2.b. To find P, the change of basis matrix from S1 to S2, we want to represent the vectors in S1 in terms of the vectors in S2. The answer you gave is correct for question C because every vector is already represented in terms of the standard unit vectors, but for this question, we want to express both vectors in S1 in terms of the vectors in S2 You can do this simultaneously for both the vectors in S1 as well. You just need to augment both vectors in S1 in S2 and take that to rref. The answer will be the result on the right-hand side. In Sage, it would look like: matrix([[a,c], [b,d]]).augment([[1,0], [0,1]], subdivide=True).rref()\n\nQ.2.d. No values for a, b, and c would make part (c) impossible, but there are values that'd make part (b) impossible. You just need to look at the answer and make sure that none of the denominators are 0.\n\nKeep working hard. You are now of the strongest students in the class. Please come to office hours if any of this is unclear",

        "comment": "Your explanation of the binary symmetric channel could be improved. The two possible outcomes in the BSC are not 0 or 1. Those are just the possible values of each bit. Rather, the outcomes are whether a bit is flipped during transmission (resulting in error) or not. The probability of being flipped or \"corrupted\" during transmission is modelled by a Bernoulli distribution with the parameter p, where p represents the probability of a bit being flipped.\n\nThe Binomial distribution can then be used to analyze the probability of decoding failure, which occurs when the receiver is unable to correct all errors in the transmitted message. The probability of decoding failure can be calculated using the Binomial distribution with parameters n and p, where n is the number of bits in the transmitted message and p is the probability of a bit being flipped.",

You could use the other application for orthogonal matrices that states that the inverse of the matrix must be its transpose and check to see if that is satisfied. That would be a much simpler step.",

        "comment": "Your questions:\n\n1. The null model is basically the model in standard conditions. If you are testing the effect of a treatment, the null model could be that the treatment has no effect. If you are comparing two treatments, the null model could be that their effects are the same. If we are wrong about how the data set was generated (our proposed hypothesis is wrong) then the null model would be true\n\n2. For discrete probability distributions, the cdf function gives P(X <= x). When measuring p values, we want to find the probability of observing something at least as extreme as our current observation P(X >= x) = 1 - P(X < x) = 1 - P(X <= x - 1). The -1 is permissible because of the discreteness of the binomial distribution\n\n3. This should just be interpreted as p = 0.01\n\n4. The posterior is actually 5.86 * 10^(-6), which is really small (and < 1)",

        "comment": "My general comment to everyone from looking across all students' descriptions of adding to iNaturalist is to emphasize the usefulness of databases, but also to understand the limitations. Some of the main ones students pointed out were the reliability of the data, sampling biases (e.g., higher likelihood of residents in wealthy areas contributing to iNaturalist), and in some cities a simple lack of sufficient data. While our use of iNaturalist was rather superficial, those are good insights on the database, and point towards the general importance of going this type of scrutiny.\n\nNext year (or maybe this year) you will be thinking about what you will do for your Capstone. It is common for NS students to use databases. One thing I'd like you to take away from this is the importance of digging into the database and understanding it and its limitations as you go through the ideation process of what research questions you could answer with the data. Do that instead of identifying a database and then waiting to dig into it until after you've identified your research question when you plan to do your analysis.",

Therefore, she's trying to **minimize** the possible gain for the opponent rather than just focusing on maximizing her own gain at a given step.\n\n2) Greedy algorithms are about making the best possible choices at a given step while DP is about considering future steps when making a current decision. A greedy algorithm is somewhat blind to anything besides the options given right now. In the readings for this class, the top-down approach was the greedy one.",

Specifically, you seem to argue that you can't have an array sorted by priority. Still, I'd disagree (you can certainly compute the priority of each task and then have a list of tuples, where each tuple will have the task (or task id) and then the corresponding utility value. \nSomething else that is not very clear is the separation of flexible tasks with and without dependencies, and how that leads to a different utility function. \n\nTo fully utilise this LO, you should start by describing the underlying strategy of an algorithm (how it works and why it is guaranteed to work) rather than focusing on the connections to the code. Overall, the description presented here is quite cluttered and difficult to follow.",

However, you evaluate it with respect to the results they found, which is more about whether the hypothesis was supported or refuted vs its development. The second two points are appropriately done. The problem with evaluating the development of a hypothesis with respect to the results is that it is similar to a problematic approach to hypothesizing called 'post hoc' hypothesizing. Post hoc hypotheses are those generated after the data have been collected, which can fall prey to biases.\n\nHere's a resource explaining the issue a bit more: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-8784.2011.00222.x",

First, the authors appear to be subject to confirmation bias when they choose the explanation for low support that is in line with their expectation of radiation with a single origin (rapid early diversification leading to weak relationships) instead of the one that is not in line (poor signal). Second, you could strengthen your evaluation of their conclusion by explaining how the other evidence supports it (e.g., why does the chronogram support this; it only includes taxa from within the presumed radiating clade?).",

        "comment": "Though your analysis is quite thorough, it is missing a core aspect of this LO which is explicitly using recurrence relations, and solving them to derive the asymptotic notation of the algorithm, alongside an explanation of what it means to have a particular big-O e.g. O(n^2) means what for when n increases? The conclusions in this question should be rewritten to account for the dominant term, dropping the less dominant terms in each of the cases (worst, average, best, etc...) so rather than having O(n) + O(1) + O(n^2), simply O(n^2) is preferable. Also note that lacking information about the tightness of the runtime growth functions applies equally to big-Omega and big-O since the former is a lower bound and the latter is an upper bound",

You can start by mentioning how such variation arises in the population in the first place. is there a special circumstance in AR that hastens that process? how are they propagated within the population to spur new species over a short period?\n\nMake sure to be specific when highlighting takeaways from class. For example, you question whether the 'heritability' part of the LO applies, but if you addressed something more specific like Dobzhansky-Muller Incompatibilities (DMIs) you would have likely made the connection with the inheritance of the alleles in different populations (Pop 1: AAbb, Pop 2: aaBB) that produce negative epistatic interactions in hybrids (AaBb doesn't work for some reason).",

The starting point in the range is included and is len(A)//2 a correct place to start from. Similarly, you'd need to adjust the interval for the for loop in the build_min_heap function.

So, you'd have to run the algorithm on the same inputs multiple times (e.g., 1000) and take the average of it. Only then you'd be able to graph the average runtimes for every input, which would be a lot more representative.  Also, you didn't provide the graphs for the step count changes.",

At the end, you make a good choice to raise the music to increase intensity while the CEO of Stradvision is speaking, but unfortunately that makes it a little difficult to hear and follow his points.

There are ways that you could have improved clarity for your audience. For example, I've read all of your fall papers and have talked to you multiple times about AVs so I know the lingo, but even a tech interested person is unlikely to know that term, so when the chyron for the Stradvision CEO came up, many people will not remember when you earlier made that definition. In those interviews, additional voice overs/interstitials to digest important points would have been helpful. Pinpointing the main question, introducing that right off the bat, and organizing each aspect of the documentary around that would improve this. [As a viewer, this is the question I see as your main question: By 2030, Seoul aims for half of vehicles sold to be autonomous vehicles. Can AV developers do that safely?]",

I'd like to see a little more attention to the truth value of the premises. For example, governmental funding of AV development really makes sense as a premise supporting your conclusion that Seoul will be successful. However, despite $85 million being a stupid amount of money, is it enough for AV development? How does that compare to what other companies are putting into AV development (I suspect it's more)? Taking a more rigorous approach to establishing the premises would improve make your application of this HC even better.",

        "comment": "You do well to address the multiple issues affecting the adoption of autonomous vehicles in Seoul. You could improve this in two ways. First, a clearer and more concise explanation of the issue you are are trying to explain would help. It comes across a little vaguely as \"Autonomous vehicles in Seoul\" with a few aspects of specificity on safety. Second, after outlining the particular safety challenges of AVs in Seoul (which is a strength of your doc), it would be even better to discuss how some of those elements interact. For example, one of the interviewees described the hope that with enough data they could effectively program safe level 5 AVs, and in another part you talk about traffic laws being written for human-driven cars. I'd be curious if the companies developing AVs are just trying to code their way out of those safety challenges, or are they also working with Seoul government to revise traffic laws. Or should the government consider more restrictive laws on AV use to avoid the the safety challenges that are difficult for the algorithms to deal with?",

        "comment": "Good start. You got one of the pure strategy NEs but didn't quite apply the correct definition to justify it. It's important to explain why neither player has an incentive to change away from this (Y,Y) equilibrium, given that the other player is doing X. And you missed the second pure NE at (X,X) which can be justified similarly: neither player would change because they'd get 1 instead of 5. \n\nI think I know what you're trying to do here with mixed NE but I'm not sure why you are assigning numerical probabilities. They should be p and (1-p) instead, right? It is indeed possible to have *both* pure and mixed NE in a game. You can find a good example of this in the following short video, which goes the next step of justifying why the mixed NE is actually less optimal than the two pure NE: http://gametheory101.com/courses/game-theory-101/calculating-payoffs-of-mixed-strategy-nash-equilibria/ \nThe text by Easley and Kleinberg is another great #gametheory reference that I hope will be valuable for your assignment.

It will be a strict Nash equilibrium if Y > 90. Under these conditions, no player could benefit from switching strategies to working on the interview given that the other is working on the project. Regardless of Y, mutually prepping for the interview remains a strict Nash equilibrium because 75 > 70, but its payoffs are inferior to what would be obtained in the group project equilibrium, assuming Y > 75. A 'rational' student that seeks to maximize their payoffs would opt to work on the group project for this payoff structure.",

However, the question asks about the odds on the prior only. You have the correct calculation, but you can improve the explanation part. P(M)/P(~M) = 0.7/(1-0.7) = 2.33 shows that initially (before collecting additional evidence), the inspector believes the odds are in favor of the maid's guilt. We could write these odds as 7:3, or state that the inspector believes 2.33 times more strongly that the maid is the murderer than not. These odds are useful, but to really assess how probable it is that the maid is guilty, as you mentioned, we would really want to take the evidence (rope) into account by multiplying this by the likelihood ratio to produce the odds on the posterior.",

I'm glad you picked up on the fact that different priors may not alter the posterior too significantly, but this really depends on the amount of quality evidence that we have. In the leprosy activity, we had 5 tests, and this amount of evidence trumped the importance of the prior. The prior has more of an impact when our evidence is limited. For example, in the first activity, we saw that the low prior (the 3% prevalence of Pymonia in the population) led to a pretty low posterior after just one test. So we might naively overestimate the posterior if we didn't incorporate known \"base rates\" correctly.",

Kahneman's point was actually that narrow framers tend to be loss averse (multiplying losses by 2 on pg 337). I hope you see that it's pretty cool that by bundling favorable gambles together in a broad frame, the probability of losing rapidly diminishes, and thus also decreases the impact of loss aversion on one's preferences! The expected value calculation is helpful here to demonstrate the average gains over all of the repeated trials. Such behavior is contradictory because the offer is exactly the same! This inconsistency, the root of which is loss aversion, points towards irrationality: \"A utility maximizer who rejects a single gamble should also reject the offer of many.\"",

This is another aspect of the possibility effect, individuals tend to be risk-averse when there is a small chance of a large loss, even when their utility function (without probability distortion) is concave up.\n \nContinue to seek more practice with these calculations (e.g., the end of the Minerva guide on expected utility) as we'll be doing more next week.",

Then try to use adobe Final Cut Pro to create a small test run, even something just 20 to 30 seconds long. Doing that as soon as possible Will help you understand some of the logistical challenges of creating a documentary. My second main piece of advice is that I think you should clarify the topic a little more sharply (e.g., more details about safety), and from there map out a framework of the content that will go in the documentary. Think through a potential content will or won't serve the audience you define.",

That narrower focus is good, and you could make your application for a problem all the more cohesive. Second, do you note some interesting obstacles do you have time to speak with us driving safely in Seoul.

All you do is provide input and wait for the output. Sometimes abstraction involves inheriting from an abstract base class eg to make a Mercedes class you may inherit from a vehicle class, then a car class, then a sedan class. \nInheritance is the act of acquiring the properties of parent classes in child classes. The vehicle example above works for this. Mercedes inherits from sedan, car and vehicle. \nEncapsulation is like bundling similarly used and being things in a single interphase eg a class. For example, when creating a payment integration using OOP, you may encapsulate everything regarding each payment provider in a class which separates that from other code such as user input, communication with the user etc\nPolymorphism is where a singular object can perform many jobs or occurs as several roles. For example, I am a student in the Minerva class system, but I am also a TA for this class, therefore, my object has permissions to access TA and student data",

        "comment": "Model answer - OOP is a programming paradigm that focusses on how using objects with data stored inside them can solve problems scalably vs procedural programming which would systematically decompose the problem and solve it in a top down approach without specifying objects as the core building block of the solution. For example, if we wanted to build forum-like polls in a small python script, making session, student and poll submission classes allows me to check each session uniquely for each student and then extract each poll by its name, whereas a procedural solution may involve decomposing the data as it comes in and perhaps checking the session against an array of dates, checking the student from a dictionary of student names and then finding the poll. The benefit of OOP is that if I wanted to extend the student to have more polls and attributes like multiple class sessions, it is easy to just add these attributes to the class \"template\", whereas a procedural solution may require me to rewrite the entire solution or update the config lists whenever I want to scale",

It is worth considering whether offering snacks can truly act as a punishment - what action is it causing you to avoid and what is the goal of offering a snack?\nThe effects of reinforcers and punishments depend on how the individual who is subject to them perceives them - a steaming piece of broccoli can be experienced as a punishment by someone or a reinforcement for another depending on whether or not eating it is a good experience. The key here is that punishment/reinforcement comes after a behavior, and the association between the two makes you engage with this action more (in the case of reinforcement) or avoid it (in the case of punishment).",

        "comment": "Good thoughts, but for a complete application of this HC, we need to try to be formal with the objective function. We have a fixed list of places to visit, so our objective will be to minimize the length (or distance) of the route. The objective function is a function that will input routes of different orders and output their length. Here, the length will be an objective value. Here, it\u2019s reasonable to think that if you minimize time, you\u2019ll end up minimizing distance too, so just picking one of these will work well. Also, your objective function here is stated such that it is no longer an optimization problem.\n \nYou're doing a good job describing the greedy approach, but I'm not sure what you mean by \"neighbor nodes\". Remember to put these terms in the real-life context. It's key to explain that these are all different permutations of the order of items in the list. You can think of the order as the decision variable. \n \nWith any of these algorithms, it's crucial to highlight whether or not they are guaranteed to achieve the *global optimum* and why.",

        "comment": "You have all the right ingredients but you might have misinterpreted the poll. I'm looking for you to distinguish between the different levels of optimization that we saw in the activities. The question here asks you to define the optimization problem for the tree growing phrase. Remember that the growing happens on the training data - just like you grew your own trees during the breakouts. So there, the objective function is the training accuracy (which we want to maximize) and the decision variables (things that can be adjusted/varied) are which attributes to use and where to make branch cuts. We discussed that maximizing the training accuracy to 100% may not actually be desirable since this could be overfitting, which brings us to the optimization problem that you define here, corresponding to the tree pruning phase. Being able to distinguish these two different levels of #optimization is a great way to show a deep understanding of this stuff! To improve further, recall that there is a tradeoff between optimizing the accuracy of the tree's performance on training data and its usefulness on future unclassified data for which the validation data serves as a proxy. There is also a tradeoff with its simplicity.",

I agree with examples you have for breadth and depth first algorithms, but I'm more interested in ways to learn about how a given algorithm works. We have to really understand it before deciding which is best for a given purpose! We saw in class that we could gain a deeper understanding by manually going through all of the steps for some simple examples. We could further improve our understanding by examining the code and matching the steps. \n \nYour examples are reasonable but I want to consider multiple scenarios. It's not always true that BFS would take the shortest steps, but DFS would be faster.

Kant's reasoning led him to think that the CI is an universal moral principle that arises out of pure logic and reason. If you only apply in certain contexts you must have a different line of reasoning and perhaps your principle is actually not the same one. The same goes for utilitarianism - the point of their theory is to say that if you accept their logic in one case, you should apply it everywhere else. So what makes you apply it in one case and not another? you have to have a reason for your judgment.\nAs an aside, the Kantian judgment to pull the lever in the first scenario but not push the man in the second does not come from a consideration of the motive but from the notion that in the second case you are using this person merely as means to save the lives of others (so it's the categorical imperative, rather than the goodwill).",

You\u2019re right that we fail to reject the null hypothesis, but then I want to see more interpretation of the actual results. It\u2019s useful to think about what this large p-value means as a probability: if we assume there's no linear relationship between these variables, the probability of finding a linear relationship as strong as this, or stronger, is 32%. For more on possible interpretations of this result, I suggest looking at the section called, \"Six possible outcomes concerning slope \u03b21\" in this optional reading: https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/2/2.1",

Similarly, very nice list comprehension in task 6, but you did len(str(res)) instead of len(res), which would've given you the correct output. The solutions were graded as correct. But very good job!

The basic approach, however, is imprecise--it would be better to specify the \"contribution\" that is being made. The vagueness of the approach impairs the topic's arguability, because it's not clear how one would disagree with this claim.\n\nThe purpose of the footnote is show you understand how #thesis works (namely, by meeting the SPARC criteria).",

Right now you write about the topic very generally, and would benefit from specifying how different agents could contribute. Obviously, drivers (depending on level of autonomy) and pedestrians are important to consider, but maybe it's even more important to think of the policy makers and AV designers.\n\nYou have a range of potential spring deliverables, but I'm not convinced they're the right ones. I think by considering what agents in the system you'll focus on, and the audience for the particular deliverables, you'll be able to make a clear choice on what's appropriate, and create a better spring final.",

        "comment": "Key Concepts of Prospect Theory: \n\nRisk aversion: People usually prefer to pay standard fares to purchase airline seats in advance rather than waiting for the possibility of last-minute bargains. We will prefer certainty over risk (even if it has some associated costs); buying insurance is another example, see fourfold pattern p. 317-18.\nReference point: Evaluation takes place relative to a neutral reference point (or \u201cadaptation level\u201d). For financial outcomes, this could be the status quo, or what you expect. for example: In talking about Madoff, students felt that 8-12% was a high rate of return (presumably their reference point is 2-5%), but this didn\u2019t raise investor\u2019s eyebrows (who might be used to hearing about 15-20% as a \"solid\" or reasonably high result).\nDiminishing sensitivity: Both sensory diminishment and the evaluation of changes of wealth. The difference between $900 and $1000 feels less than the difference between $100 and $200 (Kahneman p. 282)\nLoss aversion: \u201cLosses loom larger than gains\u201d\u2014 this is related to the slope change of the function on p. 283. \u201cYou like winning and you dislike losing, and you dislike losing more than you like winning\u201d The response to a given loss is stronger than the response to similar gain. You are moderately happy to win $50, but relatively more angry to lose $50. The fear of losing $100 is greater than the hope associated with gaining $150 (Kahneman p. 284). NB: this can be commonly confused with risk aversion. Consider drawing the S-curve (p.283) and noting the \"loss-aversion\" ratio of 1.5-2.5 (p. 284)\nMixed gamble: Gamble with a risk of loss and possibility of gain leads to loss aversion causing extremely risk-averse behavior. Coin toss: heads gain $150 and tails lose $100. The fear of losing $100 is greater than the hope associated with gaining $150 (Kahneman p. 283-5)\nBad choice: A sure loss is compared to something with a high probability of getting even worse and a low probability of getting off okay. Doubling down (risk seeking) takes place in this domain of loss. Hold a losing stock position in case the company rebounds; double down on failing strategy etc. Also see fourfold pattern p. 317 with rejecting a statistically favorable settlement in hopes of winning in litigation.\nPossibility effect: Low probabilities are magnified / treated as if they are higher (e.g. buy lottery tickets; fret over low-risk surgery)\nCertainty effect: High probabilities are treated as if they are lower (e.g. accept a settlement even though your case is strong)",

These events are not disjoint because both of them can happen at the same time. \n\nI think the root of the confusion is that you didn't clearly define the events. Review the recording to see how we defined A and B and made sense of this problem in class. Also review section 2.1 of the OpenIntro book to solidify these rules - they will lay the foundation for the rest of the unit!",

You have successfully answered the question correctly (or mostly correctly).  For these scores, you will just see the score with no comment. In addition to checking the HC rubric to see why you earned the score you did and how you might improve your application, Prof Stan created the document linked below that you can reference to see compiled feedback for the entire section, so that you can review the common patterns and see examples of how you can improve your score when you use the HC in the future.\n\nIf you score a 4 (or a 5!), you have done an excellent job of demonstrating your understanding of the topic! Very well done! Keep aiming for this level of depth and rigor in future assignments. \n\nComments and Patterns document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qOR8lvhnnT5Rve5OT_s2C5ocOZaDmDQqe91JfmJndqw/edit#",

But I wish you gave some interpretations to your inferences. \n\nLet's go one more step and think about what that tells us about the climate: it's warmer on average in recent years and there's more variability in the data in recent years.\n\nThe only other thing to note here is about measures of location: the second mean and median are larger than the first. So in recent years, the main bulk of the distribution would be shifted to the right compared to the 1895-1974 period (meaning that it's warmer on average now than it was before).\n\nWe also focussed on skew during class, so what can you notice about that here? During 1895-1974, mean-median = -0.02 and during recent years, we have mean-median = 0.8 (40 times bigger in magnitude). We'd thus expect the first histogram to be fairly symmetric and the second to have a right skew, meaning that more data is to the left of the mean and there is a tail pulling the distribution positively to the right. We can interpret this to mean that there are more extreme high temperatures in the recent set of data.\n \nHowever, these statistics are not enough to infer the exact shape of the histogram! For instance, the histograms could be bimodal like we saw in class.",

However, to improve further, I would encourage you to focus on one HC fully. Here, for a better application of #deduction I would like you to use elements of the specific argument given to justify why the conclusion does indeed (or not) follow necessarily from the premises. This justification needs to be very clear and convincing and should rely on the \u201cfactors\u201d introduced in the Wilkins reading on induction. Also, you could identify an effective way to breakdown the argument into symbolic logic.",

The question \"Should social media platforms be allowed to track our online behavior to inform their advertising strategy\" is still a pretty big question!

Like simulations in Netlogo, human social systems may also be possible to explain in terms of simple rules that govern individual agents and lead to emergent group behavior, e.g., pedestrian movement on a busy sidewalk. For example, in many countries, people walk on the right side of the sidewalk in whichever direction they are going: this is not an explicit rule, but it can explain the general flow of foot traffic. In other words, individual people are the individual agents in social systems, and they interact according to a number of formal rules and norms that, when discerned, can be helpful in understanding the nature of interactions and the results of interactions.",

The weather system, like the Game of Life, has emergent properties that are due to interactions between parts, is highly sensitive to initial conditions, etc. Of course, it is true that weather remains difficult to predict for exactly the preceding reasons: including that interactions among component parts give rise to behavior that is resistant to long-term predictions. We know hurricanes arise but cannot reliably predict where and when.",

I think you have a great set of types of information, but wanted to push you further in connecting the dots here, overall, I think these are great points!",

When this happens to you, do not fret, try not to get discouraged, and do not struggle on your own for more than 30-45 minutes without seeking assistance from peers/TAs/professors. The most common mistake my students make is they spend _hours_ stuck on a simple technical issue (like a missing character or  quotation mark in a line of code) that a knowledgable person could address in _seconds -- and this is counterproductive. _We use a chat platform called Piazza to post questions/comments/responses -- more information on this will be coming your way before the first day of class.

The first part of the course focuses on parametric and non-parametric predictive modelling (regression, cross-validation, bootstrapping, random forests, etc.) focusing on important and practical aspects that are not widely taught (e.g., simulation-based approaches to regression for estimating prediction intervals). The second part of the course focuses on causal inference in randomized control trials and observational studies (statistical matching, synthetic control methods, encouragement design/instrument variables, regression discontinuity design, etc.). Technical aspects of the course focus on computational approaches and real-world challenges, drawing cases from the life sciences, public policy and political science, education, and business. This course will also emphasize the importance of being able to articulate one\u2019s findings effectively and tailor methodology and policy/decision-relevant recommendations for different audiences.\n\n\u200b\n\nNote: _This syllabus is subject to change._",

Long Grove, Ill.: Waveland Press: pp 55-69)\\\n  \\ devised these general guidelines for asking questions about things you want to\\\n  \\ focus on and are curious about, based on your observations from your initial meeting\\\n  \\ (focused observation). Please remember to first establish a good rapport with\\\n  \\ your \\u201C_cultural informant_\\u201D, be respectful and courteous and avoid pressuring\\\n  \\ them or making them uncomfortable if there are sensitive topics.\\n\\n- Listen closely\\\n  \\ and restate what informants say, using their language.\\n- Don\\u2019t ask for meaning,\\\n  \\ ask for use. \\u201CWhy\\u201D questions and asking people to explain what they\\\n  \\ mean should be avoided because this may pressure people, convey an evaluative\\\n  \\ judgment, and result in defensiveness. Rely more upon, \\u201Cwhat\\u201D, \\u201C\\\n  when\\u201D, \\u201Cwhere\\u201D and \\u201Chow\\u201D questions. For example, if you\\\n  \\ are trying to understand a phrase, you could ask: \\u201CWhat are some other ways\\\n  \\ you might talk about \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_? \\u201CWould someone ever say \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_?\\u201D\\\n  . By getting at the use of a term or custom, the meaning is often clarified indirectly.\\\n  \\ \\u201CHow else do you celebrate \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_?\\u201D is a possible\\\n  \\ question for a custom.\\n- Express both verbal and nonverbal interest in what informants\\\n  \\ say. If they feel you are only doing this to get a grade or because you look down\\\n  \\ on their beliefs or customs, they will not make an effort to help you learn.\\n\\\n  - Express cultural ignorance. \\u201CI didn\\u2019t know that. I never thought of\\\n  \\ that.\\u201D\\n- Encourage informants to expand rather than abbreviate what they\\\n  \\ say, to go into greater rather than less detail. Ask follow-on questions when\\\n  \\ there seems to be more that could be shared. Don\\u2019t assume that you understand\\\n  \\ what they mean.\\n- Incorporate the informant\\u2019s terms to show that you are\\\n  \\ learning and to verify their meaning.\\n- Ask friendly questions \\u2013 don\\u2019\\\n  t act like a journalist who just wants a story.\\n- Thank them when you take your\\\n  \\ leave: \\u201CI\\u2019ve really learned a lot today.\\u201D\\n\\n**C) Assignment Requirements:**\\n\\\n  \\nWrite-up what you learned from your Informant using the above processes. Your\\\n  \\ paper should be a typed, double-spaced report of 500-1000 words. Please include\\\n  \\ a snapshot of your own and your informant\\u2019s GSP results on the last page\\\n  \\ of your PDF submission. Each submission should have two profiles or they can be\\\n  \\ combined within one diagram and labelled appropriately.\"\ndo_plagiarism_detection: true\ndue: 6.Sat@11pm\nfaculty_description: null\ngrade_by: 8.Sun@11pm\ngroup_count: 0\ngrouping: ''\nlength: 500-1000 words\nnum: 8331\npython_notebook: null\nresources: []\nscoring_category_default: neither\nsubmission: file\nsupported_extensions: pdf\nterm: Fall 2021\ntitle: Ethnography Interview Project Assignment Step 1\ntype: individual\nweight: 1\n",

You should then upload the assignments in your dashboard for the IL91 course.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis course is the first semester of an 8-semester curriculum, which provides students with tools to face the challenging process of personal and character growth, and prepares students for effective citizenship in a diverse multicultural society. [Integrated Learning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rih0KEO6bNAyCwRBZT-44elAPsZPuF6m_WMrVmGfNw4/edit#heading=h.30j0zll) is a framework that bridges academic learning with personal and character development across multiple dimensions. The societies of the world are challenged by a variety of complex issues in all sectors; technological and economic developments have caused us to be hyper-connected and interdependent. This same connectivity has resulted in a heightened need for collective action and hence for people and organizations that are culturally agile and can work effectively and appropriately across differences. This course will provide a wide range of opportunities and experiences that encourage students to practice and develop skills, knowledge, and attitudes that help them develop and integrate all of their learning, within and outside academic courses.Five areas of growth, named Integrated Learning Outcomes, are highlighted within this framework. The five areas emphasize key outcomes, and students are expected to engage in all areas throughout their Minerva journey across the four years. The Integrated Learning Outcomes (ILOs) are:\n\n- Self-Management and Wellness,\n- Interpersonal Engagement,\n- Intercultural Competency,\n- Professional Development\n- Civic Responsibility.\n\nEach ILO is an expected outcome of student learning at Minerva, with the understanding that they are also broad areas of ongoing, lifelong growth. Note that a number of HCs are relevant for each ILO. As are the HCs, each ILO is complex and multilayered. Each ILO encompasses challenges that are unique to each individual, and may vary by one\u2019s developmental phase in life. Each 0.5 credit course involves the following hours of work, which, for this semester includes:\n\n-3 hours of pre-work that should be completed prior to Foundation week\n\n-3 hours sessions during Foundation week\n\n-16/18 hours during the semester\n\n-1 hour closing session at the end of the semester\n\nOver the four years, Minerva encourages its students to take full advantage of the city immersions through the programs offered, which will help students to become better informed about the key aspects of the history, culture, and arts of each one of the Minerva countries/cities they will reside in or explore in other ways.\n",

Skills get better with practice. Practice only works\\\n  \\ if you can make mistakes and learn from them. Therefore, you need to practice\\\n  \\ your writing. A lot. And you need to be free to make mistakes. And then you need\\\n  \\ to learn from them.\\n\\n\\u200B\\n\\nThroughout this semester, you will keep a writing\\\n  \\ journal. This writing journal is a place for you to practice your written communication.\\\n  \\ You will see weekly prompts on your Dashboard asking to write something specific,\\\n  \\ practicing the HCs we are learning in class.\\n\\n\\u200B\\n\\nFor example, see Session\\\n  \\ 2 on your Dashboard. You will see under the Pre-Class Work heading:\\n\\n**AFTER\\\n  \\ CLASS**\\n\\n++**Writing Journal Entry 1:**++\\n\\nAfter this class, write an entry\\\n  \\ about your own personal experience of #interpretivelens. Explain how you became\\\n  \\ aware of your own #interpretivelens in a situation which you describe in the entry.\\n\\\n  \\n\\u200B\\n\\nYou will turn in the writing journal three times during the semester.\\\n  \\ The submission of this journal is not something you can cram for. You can only\\\n  \\ succeed if you keep a practice of having regular intervals where you spend dedicated,\\\n  \\ focused time working on your writing.\\n\\n\\u200B\\n\\nWe suggest that for each entry\\\n  \\ in your writing journal, you specify the date, the amount of time you intend to\\\n  \\ write, and the HC you are practicing. There's no set length for each entry, but\\\n  \\ 200-300 words is a good range to aim for.\\n\\n\\u200B\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\\u200B\\n\\\n  \\n**Date:** Friday, September 4. **Time:** 20 minutes. **HC: **#interpretivelens\\n\\\n  \\n[20 minutes of text responding to the prompt goes here].\\n\\n\\u200B\\n\\n**Before\\\n  \\ the deadlines, convert the journal into a pdf and upload to the Dashboard.**\\n\\\n  \\n\\u200B\\n\\n**FAQs**\\n\\nQ: What is the #purpose of the writing journal?\\n\\nA: The\\\n  \\ #purpose is to give you opportunities to practice writing frequently and consistently.\\\n  \\ The goal is not to achieve depth or polish, but rather, to help you to write more\\\n  \\ spontaneously and fluidly.\\n\\n\\u200B\\n\\nQ: Do we have to use all of the HCs that\\\n  \\ are listed at the bottom of the assignment prompt or all the HCs we learned in\\\n  \\ this unit? \\n\\nA: No, you need to use only the HC that is being prompted in the\\\n  \\ entry prompt. If there is no specific HC mentioned in the prompt, you do not need\\\n  \\ to apply any specific ones. You will be submitting the journal 3 times this semester.\\\n  \\ You may be graded on one of the ones listed below over the course of the semester.\\n\\\n  \\n\\u200B\\n\\nQ: Do we have to tag and justify every use of an HC?\\n\\nA: In a bigger\\\n  \\ assignment, you will have to tag and footnote HCs. In the writing journal, you\\\n  \\ do not need to tag HCs unless you are explicitly instructed to do so.\\n\\n\\u200B\\\n  \\n\\nQ: Is it ok if I go over the word-count? Do I have to include the word count\\\n  \\ after each entry?\\n\\nA: The point of the journal is to practice writing, so if\\\n  \\ you end up writing more than required, great! The only time you don\\u2019t want\\\n  \\ to write a lot is when concision is implied in the prompt. For example, in entry\\\n  \\ 3, you are asked to write an HC footnote, which should be a _concise_ justification\\\n  \\ of an HC application. You do not need to provide word count with the journal entries;\\\n  \\ you will for larger papers.\\n\\n\\u200B\\n\\nQ: How do I submit the journal? Do I\\\n  \\ have to submit every entry?\\n\\nA: Turn your Google doc into a pdf and upload onto\\\n  \\ Forum. Yes, you should submit every entry you have written thus far. For the second\\\n  \\ and third submissions, submit the new entries since the previous submissions.\\n\\\n  \\n\\u200B\\n\\nQ: If I used another source, should I provide a bibliography? \\n\\nA:\\\n  \\ You weren\\u2019t expected to do any research for these entries, but yes, whenever\\\n  \\ you use others\\u2019 words or ideas, you should provide citation. If it's a reading\\\n  \\ from class, a parenthetical citation is sufficient: e.g., (\\\"Story of Your Life,\\\"\\\n  \\ Chiang). If you use a source from outside of class, you should provide at the\\\n  \\ least the authors\\u2019 name, pub. year, title of text.\\n\\n\\u200B\\n\\nQ: Should\\\n  \\ I proofread and make sure the journal is clean and free of errors?\\n\\nA: As you\\\n  \\ practice writing, you should naturally become a more polished writer, but we will\\\n  \\ not be grading you on grammar and spelling. Again, the point is consistent practice,\\\n  \\ not polish.\\n\\n\\u200B\"\ndo_plagiarism_detection: true\ndue: 4.Thu@11pm\nfaculty_description: 'This shouldn''t be an onerous grading burden.

Assignments will be weighted relative to HC-scored class polls and activities based on the values shown in the table below. All assessments will be scored based on the quality of HC application. For more information, see the \u201cAssessment\u201d section in the policies below.\n\n* **HC-scored Class Polls and Activities**: Each 90-minute class session will be taught on Forum. During each class, students will answer a preparatory assessment poll and a reflection poll, which occur at the beginning and end of class respectively. These polls may be HC scored. In addition, some class activities will be selected for video scoring. Students will be alerted to scored activities when scores on polls and activities are released.\n\n* **Signature Assignments:** These are original works (e.g., essays, short papers, problem sets or models) that consolidate the student\u2019s work on a combined set of HCs. The work is graded against a mandatory set of HCs that must be addressed. In addition, the student may address other HCs introduced earlier in this, or any other, Cornerstone course.\n\n* **Location-based Assignment:** All Minerva courses include a location-based assignment (LBA). Each location-based assignment involves engaging in an activity in the student\u2019s current city of residence, and targets application of HCs in a new, real-world, context. LBAs are estimated to require at least 5 hours with your city of residence, as well as additional time for  preparation, research, and writing up the work product to submit. We understand that in the current public health crisis the ability to engage with locations will vary by student, and will ensure that all students are given the opportunity to excel in their LBA.\n\n* **Cornerstone Civic Project:** Each semester, students complete a single civic project across all four cornerstone classes. Cornerstone Civic Projects are described more toward the end of the syllabus and will appear as a separate course on Forum.",

                    "description": "# **Overview**\n\nStructured Study Sessions (SSS) for programming are designed to help first-year students develop the necessary programming skills to succeed in the Cornerstones. These skills are most relevant for succeeding in Formal Analyses, but certainly have much broader applicability throughout the curriculum and beyond. Computer programming is an incredibly flexible and powerful tool\u2014even if one knows just the basics. It can change the way one thinks about solving problems and can open a new world of opportunity. We want all students to have these skills at their disposal.\n\nStudents come to Minerva with varying levels of programming knowledge. The summer preparation resources are provided to help cover any gaps in knowledge, but this does not prove effective for all students. For those who do not pass the pre-Minerva summer programming assessments, the SSS provide another opportunity to build up their skills so they can successfully complete all coursework with confidence. SSS is mandatory for students that receive a \u2713- in the summer assessments. Students who passed the summer assessments but still want to gain confidence in their skills are encouraged to opt into the sessions on a weekly basis using this [++submission form++](https://forms.gle/ABDnXHPXCtB45Rzj9), but are not required to attend. They may also follow along with the material on their own (or form their own study groups) and visit Peer Tutor\u2019s office hours for help as needed.\n\nAs you probably know, learning to code takes a lot of repeated practice. However, as you also know, learning to code can be frustrating. The syntax is confusing, the code never works the first time around, and motivation can be hard to find when you\u2019re on your own. This is why the SSS are designed to provide an opportunity to practice in a friendly environment with classmates and Peer Tutors who can give extra guidance and support. To facilitate this environment, students shall meet once a week on Forum for one hour. During this hour, students work in breakouts through a series of coding exercises and learning material, with Peer Tutors available to answer questions. This setup ensures students are getting hands-on practice with the concepts and that the necessary support from Peer Tutors is available as they work.\n\nWill one hour of coding practice per week take students from beginner to master? No. Attending the SSS will provide students with helpful resources, but it is ultimately up to them to pursue extra practice. We hope that students take advantage of the additional problems in the Exercise notebooks (described below) and visit [++Peer Tutor\u2019s Office Hours++](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1WIe6OCPeKnwauLbMBTPib8A8c4gsy-koj1EKDE5VR3o/edit) for further assistance.\n\nFor the programming SSS, the material students are expected to work on each week has two parts: **Lab** and **Exercise**.\n\n1. The purpose of the **Lab** section is to familiarize students with specific Python skills that are needed for classes and assignments. The Lab Integrates pre-worked examples, instructions, and short practice questions to provide students a chance to experiment with the code in order to understand the material better. The Lab section will be worked on during the sessions, in pairs, and students will be required to submit their Lab workbook at the end of the session. Students who miss the class will be required to submit the Lab as makeup work within 7 days.\n2. The **Exercise** notebook will provide a place to practice the skills learned in the Lab section with a set of comprehensive and holistic problem solving questions. A notebook with the weekly Exercises will be released after students complete the Lab (after the session) and is intended to be worked on alone, so that students can gauge how much of the material they personally understand and can apply. However, students can (and should!) attend Peer Tutor\u2019s Office Hours for help with the Exercises. Submitting the Exercise notebook will be optional, but \\_highly \\_encouraged. We hope students take advantage of this resource to get more practice and feedback on their work with problems that were purposely curated to help them improve their coding skills.\n\n# **Participants' Responsibilities**\n\n## 1. Preparation\n\n- The class page will usually recommend relevant videos and readings from external courses such as Udacity and Datacamp that should be familiar for you from the Cornerstone summer preparation program. Watching these videos will ensure that you come to the session equipped with the required knowledge to solve the tasks.\n- Students also need to come prepared to focus, learn, and engage with peers. It is recommended to close all tabs and windows in the background, turn off notifications, and make the most of the hour with peers and Peer Tutors. This is easier said than done. Students are referred to this resource, [++Forum Magic++](https://course-resources.minerva.kgi.edu/uploaded_files/mke/00229503-5474/forum-magic.pdf), to learn about the \u201cmagical\u201d cognitive processes in our brain that affect our attention during online interactions. The document also explains several best practices for limiting distractions during class.\n- **Before arriving at the first SSS**, read the syllabus in full. Questions about the syllabus and policies can be directed to sss\\_coding@minerva.edu. **We also recommend that you set up Python on your laptop, following the **[++**instructions here**++](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xKJUDHUBYQ9B3gYmvK6QEGsdxDcsgRh_Q_hxIPHHf1c/edit?usp=sharing)**.**\n\n## 2. During the session\n\nStudents are assigned to a classroom in Forum with supervising Peer Tutors. During the sessions, students work in small breakout groups through a set of prepared coding tasks in the \u201cLab\u201d workbook. Forum code workbooks will be used to facilitate collaboration. Participants are encouraged to ask Peer Tutors for help during the session if any difficulties are encountered with the exercises or if there are any questions about the material.\n\nSome of the workbooks provide students with a way to test their code and see if it works correctly. This feature is meant to provide students with immediate feedback on their progress, indicating whether their work is complete and correct. If an error is indicated, students should go back and try to fix it! This is an important part of the learning process! The results (how many tasks were correct vs incorrect) will not directly affect your HC scores or Cornerstones grades in any way. However, students should note that the data from previous years supports the claim that students who perform better during the SSS also receive higher HC scores.\n\n## 3. At the end of the session\n\nAt the end of the session, students are expected to submit their work two ways.\n\n1. **Miupload. **Simply follow the instructions in the notebook or workbook. Your code will be uploaded to our server upon running the Miupload cell(s).\n2. **Reflection Poll.** There will be a poll at the end of the session in which you must paste in a URL link to the breakout workbook. Simply pop out the breakout resource into a new tab, copy the URL, and paste it into the poll box. Unlike a typical reflection poll in other classes, this poll will not be HC-scored. Comments may be provided from your Peer Tutors, as explained in the \u201cAfter the session\u201d section below.\n\nWhat if the one-hour session ends before your breakout group has finished the Lab workbook? See below.\n\n## 4. After the session\n\nKeep the momentum going! A subset of Peer Tutors will hold their Office Hours directly following the SSS timeslot so that students who still have questions or want to continue working, on either the Lab or Exercises, can do so under Peer Tutor supervision. Another subset of Peer Tutors will hold Office Hours at different times, please see below for more details.\n\nAccess to resources: After exiting the classroom, students will retain access to the work they did in breakouts. Students can locate this by re-entering the class and navigating to the class resources at the end, or simply by referring to the link in their reflection poll submission. Here is an example of how to retrieve breakout resources from inside the classroom:\n\n1. Navigate to the particular session: ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/alcgSUZw4ZedBOSVx-m3nyNhBC4_rslLdA-T6HPOVi6GPerpyYQhPMBghNUkoIqG4PNW1rmBZN8OYoVleOtrc5dRKDStNcw8qNPMi9-TO2YoFA5UePLjJ-0BZ_EjB4weDGrB95zV=s0)\n2. Press \u201cEnter Class\u201d on the right side: ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/boht-5HRSH1bu9P0RlmpLIa_I3-b2eCpEG9axt1i1_175IvEWfSrbUkTbtTXZZQm51__MhPjwmgkifYPEdffE_HDY2ObHZXK8zm8AR9PS6lsJq0VYJ9zM5b2jl30AyjKKG73sxHN=s0)\n3. From inside the class press the \u201cresources\u201d button from the right sidebar: ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/cVFJn0i7PuRLh9zuvmRSsma0v31dx2no8XlNmRoZ6arCrGC_vAw-c0uHGpNeeWeIvL1JWKZIkxhlkvxyUV77mFxnJTuLzaqREEGeyjvnhwYpO_L-X5bUsAguxg-6x3JD1OhkZ_SP=s0)\n4. From the menu that opens in the right, scroll to find your breakout group resource: ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WlohLrjmLsva9Eg1VzhgLerZ49w6DMco7uVsbxxXQY5dE08GHgVAtF9G4q8EU_ztpT4ndZZWi7Z2t6A9JiGOZe8QDE_htuW6AxAvrsX_77ErADd1zviSurTBKNV8RtEZLszueura=s0)\n5. Click on the arrow in the top-right of the document to open it in a new tab.\n6. Done! Now you can see the code you\u2019ve written with your buddy during the session.\n\nStudents can continue to work within class workbooks by opening them in a tab outside of the classroom. However, these versions are still shared. Any changes made will be visible by your groupmate(s) and Peer Tutors. Also, please refrain from running the Miupload code again. It only needs to be run once during the session.\n\nAdditionally, **access to Jupyter notebook versions for both the Lab and the Exercises** will be made available in this [++Google Drive folder++](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1snZmVn_W7i3bw8OXxInYX-af8lHCo4yk?usp=sharing). As described above, the Exercise notebook will provide a place to practice the skills learned during the SSS Lab with a set of comprehensive and holistic problem solving questions. It is intended to be worked on alone, so that students can gauge how much of the material they personally understand and can apply. However, students can (and should!) attend Peer Tutor\u2019s Office Hours for help with the Exercises. Submitting the Exercise notebook via Miupload will be optional, but highly encouraged.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Feedback**: Sometime after the session, Peer Tutors will review the work that students did during the session (through their reflection poll submission) and provide some feedback to students on their progress. Students can view this feedback in Forum in the form of comments on the polls. Students are welcome to reach out to their Peer Tutors (e.g. during Office Hours) for more direct feedback or tips on how to improve.\n\n# **Drop-in Peer Tutor Office Hours**\n\nEach Peer Tutor is asked to set aside 1-2 hours per week for \u201cOffice Hours\u201d. Refer to [++this spreadsheet++](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1WIe6OCPeKnwauLbMBTPib8A8c4gsy-koj1EKDE5VR3o/edit) for the times, locations, and your Peer Tutors' availability. You are encouraged to visit your Peer Tutors' Office Hours for all coding-related assistance! You can attend any of the Peer Tutors\u2019 Office Hours, not only those that are supervising your SSS group. It\u2019s a great chance for you to get 1-1 help reviewing material from the previous SSS, asking coding questions from FA class, or getting clarification on coding questions for FA assignments.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that your Professors also hold weekly Office Hours too, and they are more than happy to help with questions on this material. In particular, **questions about the expectations for classes and assignments** should be directed to your **Professor** rather than Peer Tutors.\n\nIt is your responsibility to review the Office Hours schedules and plan accordingly. So, please **do not **take advantage of your Peer Tutors by staying past the time allotted for Office Hours or asking them for a significant amount of help outside of these times. In addition,** do not** ask any Peer Tutor for direct answers to any assignment problem or SSS exercise. They are there to help you improve your skills and understanding, not to find the answer to a particular problem.\n\n# **The Science of Learning in the SSS**\n\nDuring week 1 in Empirical Analyses, you will learn about Stephen Kosslyn\u2019s sixteen learning principles of the science of learning, outlined [here](https://hub.minerva.kgi.edu/academics/curriculum/science-of-learning-2/). You should think about how these principles can be applied to help your learning in the SSS. Here are some examples that you may find it useful to be aware and take advantage of:\n\n1. _Evoking deep processing_: the \u201cLab\u201d portion of the SSS has multiple short quizzes that ask you to explain why things work the way they do.\n2. _Using desirable difficulty_: the difficulty level aims to match what is needed in FA. There are some optional challenge questions if students wish to explore more.\n3. _Engaging in deliberate practice_: the SSS\u2019s cover this principle in a few different ways:\n\n\n- Firstly, the exercises often present students with flawed code, asking them to explain the error and fix it. This mimics the common mistakes that students might make when they program and demonstrates how to debug.\n- In addition, since deliberate practice works best when _feedback_ is given along the way, and when careful attention is paid to one\u2019s _own mistakes_, the SSS notebooks have built in tests to check if the code is correct and complete. These tests provide students with immediate feedback on their work and indicate whether something needs to be corrected.\n- Lastly, Peer Tutors are readily available during the SSS to provide personal immediate feedback and help students to find and fix errors, thus learning from them.\n\n\n1. _Inducing dual coding_: the SSS notebooks are filled with diagrams and photos to depict concepts whenever appropriate (for example, a diagram to explain the execution of the if-else statements).\n2. _Promoting chunking_: this is facilitated in the SSS notebooks by ensuring a block of content is not too long and using clear headings.\n3. _Building on prior associations_: the activities in the SSS often draw from or preview to FA activities and assignments.\n4. _Presenting foundational material first_: each SSS is designed to introduce the basic concepts first and give examples, and exercises are later given for you to apply concepts to solve problems.\n5. _Exploiting appropriate examples_: between the SSS, class activities, and assignments, you will be able to see the same coding techniques applied in a wide variety of examples.\n6. _Relying on principles, not rote_: conceptual understanding is of equal or greater importance than executing the code. When asking Peer Tutors for help, you should aim to have a good understanding of the problem and how to approach it rather than just asking for the answer.\n7. _Creating associative chaining (a.k.a using story telling)_: some of the SSS\u2019s are motivated using a \u201cstory\u201d of a student who wants to learn how to run statistical tests on his data, for example.\n8. _Using spaced practice_: cramming before an assignment is due will never work, so, the SSS\u2019s are spaced to help you build up the needed skills and work on parts of your assignment from week to week.\n9. ...can you think of other ways to apply the principles as you participate in the SSS?\n\nAs mentioned before, you may at times simply feel no motivation to learn code. In Kosslyn's paper, he mentions that _motivation_ is not part of any of the learning principles. Instead, _engagement_ is the key. The SSS\u2019s include plenty of interactive features to promote engagement whenever possible, so be sure to take advantage of this.

To help students learn the HCs and build practical knowledge, the\\\n  \\ curriculum is organized around a number of \\u201CBig Questions\\u201D that recur\\\n  \\ in multiple Cornerstones. The Big Questions provide some background content so\\\n  \\ that the HCs can be practiced and applied in a variety of relevant contexts. They\\\n  \\ also allow students to reflect on the applicability of the HCs in a larger context.\\\n  \\ For this assignment, you will argue two sides of a claim thematically related\\\n  \\ to a Big Question. You may choose any Big Question from the [Cornerstone Curriculum\\\n  \\ Map](https://hub.minerva.kgi.edu/academics/curriculum/foundation-year/cornerstone-curriculum-map/)\\\n  \\ that interests you. It does not matter whether the Big Question you choose has\\\n  \\ been introduced in your class yet or not.\\n\\nDevelop an arguable stance on a component\\\n  \\ of the Big Question. This need not be an actual \\u201Canswer\\u201D to the question\\\n  \\ itself, but rather a claim that can be argued for or against. The claim needs\\\n  \\ to be \\u201Carguable\\u201D in the sense that the answer is not obviously \\u201C\\\n  yes\\u201D or \\u201Cno.\\u201D In fact, you will have to craft arguments for _both_\\\n  \\ sides. So, you will also have to develop an opposing claim that goes against the\\\n  \\ original. You\\u2019ll notice in the examples below that the competing stance could\\\n  \\ be the logical opposite (Y = not X), but it need not be. What makes the most sense\\\n  \\ depends on the question and claim that you chose. You\\u2019re encouraged to make\\\n  \\ your stance as specific as possible, which will require narrowing the scope of\\\n  \\ the question. Narrower, more specific, claims will be easier to support and lead\\\n  \\ to clearer arguments! Here are some examples:\\n\\n- Big Question: How is free choice\\\n  \\ manipulated?\\n    - Claim: X = Advertisement standards are appropriate.\\n    -\\\n  \\ Competing stance: Y = Advertisement standards need to be stricter.\\n- Big Question:\\\n  \\ How can we use machines to solve problems and make decisions?\\n    - Claim: X\\\n  \\ = Algorithms mitigate hiring biases.\\n    - Competing stance: Y = Algorithms perpetuate\\\n  \\ hiring biases.\\n- Big Question: How do we understand global pandemics?\\n    -\\\n  \\ Claim: X = A waiver of intellectual property protections on COVID-19 vaccines\\\n  \\ should be implemented.\\n    - Competing stance: Y = A waiver of intellectual property\\\n  \\ protections on COVID-19 vaccines should not be implemented.\\n- Big Question: Why\\\n  \\ do people commit crimes?\\n    - Claim: X = Poverty is the most important factor\\\n  \\ in determining why people commit crimes.\\n    - Competing stance: Y = Peer pressure\\\n  \\ is the most important factor in determining why people commit crimes.\\n\\nThere\\\n  \\ are two parts of this assignment below, and in each part, you will argue for a\\\n  \\ different side of the stance. In PART 1, you must craft **deductive** arguments\\\n  \\ for claim X; and in PART 2, you must craft **inductive** arguments for claim Y.\\\n  \\ Developing an argument for a claim means that your premises should arrive at the\\\n  \\ claim as the conclusion: P1, P2, P3, \\u2026, Therefore, X.\\n\\nBelow, you can find\\\n  \\ some specific example arguments, but you should not follow these examples too\\\n  \\ closely. Students who copy content from these examples (or any other source) or\\\n  \\ just substitute the words while keeping the exact same argument structure will\\\n  \\ be referred to the ASC. Your arguments must be your own original work and must\\\n  \\ make sense for your question and stance. As stated above, the arguments can be\\\n  \\ as simple or as sophisticated as you wish. However, they should not be as simple\\\n  \\ a basic modus-ponens argument. Get creative! Just bear in mind that while more\\\n  \\ sophisticated arguments would allow for a richer analysis in which you can showcase\\\n  \\ a deeper level of knowledge, they are more prone to analysis errors.\\n\\n- Deductive\\\n  \\ argument example 1:\\n    - P1. If an individual lives in poverty, they live in\\\n  \\ a state of desperation.\\n    - P2. If an individual is desperate, they will resort\\\n  \\ to extreme measures to survive.\\n    - P3. If an individual is resorting to extreme\\\n  \\ measures to survive, they are likely to engage in criminal behavior.\\n    - X.\\\n  \\ Thus, if an individual lives in poverty, they are more likely to engage in criminal\\\n  \\ behavior.\\n- Deductive argument example 2:\\n    - P1. When it comes to hiring\\\n  \\ decisions, either humans are more unbiased or computers are more unbiased.\\n \\\n  \\   - P2. Humans have cognitive biases that impair fair judgment of candidates.\\n\\\n  \\    - P3. If humans have cognitive biases that impair fair judgment of candidates,\\\n  \\ then they are not more unbiased with respect to hiring decisions.\\n    - X. Therefore,\\\n  \\ computers are more unbiased to make hiring decisions.\\n- Inductive argument example\\\n  \\ 1:\\n    - P1. According to the UK Body image report (2021), one in five people\\\n  \\ l shame about their body image.\\n    - P2. The same report states that advertisements\\\n  \\ in the media perpetuate negative body image.\\n    - P3. As reported by the Advertising\\\n  \\ Standards Authority (2020), there are currently no restrictions on the placing\\\n  \\ of ads for cosmetic interventions to young people under the age of 18.\\n    -\\\n  \\ P4. Thus, stricter policies are needed to limit exposure for ads for cosmetic\\\n  \\ and weight-loss interventions.\\n    - Y. Therefore, advertising standards in the\\\n  \\ UK need to be stricter.\\n- Inductive argument example 2:\\n    - P1. Since a majority\\\n  \\ of the world population lives in countries that are highly developed, most people\\\n  \\ infected by COVID-19 worldwide will not be wealthy.\\n    - P3. On the other hand,\\\n  \\ most research on COVID-19 vaccines takes place in wealthy countries and most vaccine\\\n  \\ patents are owned by people and organizations in wealthy countries.\\n    - P4.\\\n  \\ Poverty is sometimes a causal factor in law breaking such as thefts.\\n    - P5.\\\n  \\ This implies that a waiver of intellectual property laws for COVID-19 research\\\n  \\ could prevent a large number of thefts.\\n    - Y. Therefore, a waiver of intellectual\\\n  \\ property protections on COVID-19 vaccines should not be implemented.\\n\\n\\u200B\\\n  \\n\\n**Analysis**:\\n\\n1. Select a Big Question and identify an arguable claim (X)\\\n  \\ and a competing stance (Y). Follow the guidelines above to ensure that your claim\\\n  \\ is arguable and sufficiently narrow/specific. Explain briefly why you chose this\\\n  \\ Big Question and how you identified a claim to argue for and against (<100 words).\\n\\\n  \\n\\u200B\\n\\n# **PART 1**\\n\\nIn this part, you will work with _one side_ of the stance\\\n  \\ only (X). Craft two brief arguments in favor of this claim using **deductive reasoning**.\\\n  \\ One argument should be a valid deduction and one should contain a fallacy. Write\\\n  \\ these arguments in natural language in simple terms with clear use of logical\\\n  \\ connectives and atomic sentences so that it is amenable for the following analysis.\\n\\\n  \\n\\u200B\\n\\n**Analysis** [#deduction, #fallacies, #algorithms]:\\n\\n1. Clearly identify\\\n  \\ the features of these arguments that make them deductive and explain why (<75\\\n  \\ words).\\n2. For the **valid deduction**:\\n    1. Translate your argument into\\\n  \\ symbolic logic and provide brief commentary for how you developed the translation.\\n\\\n  \\    2. Choose two sentences from the argument and negate them using DeMorgan\\u2019\\\n  s laws. Ideally, you should choose two sentences that have different logical connectives.\\\n  \\ Translate the negations back into English.\\n    3. Prove that the argument is\\\n  \\ indeed valid using a formal proof.\\n    4. Discuss the soundness of the argument\\\n  \\ (<100 words).\\n    5. _Optional_: Negate each of the premises of your argument\\\n  \\ and derive a valid conclusion, being sure to explain the derivation and comment\\\n  \\ on the soundness. If it is impossible to form a valid argument from these premises,\\\n  \\ explain why.\\n3. Python:\\n    1. Use Python to assess the validity of the argument.\\n\\\n  \\        1. The code should output whether or not the argument is valid (it should\\\n  \\ be valid!) based on a truth table. You are not required to print the full truth\\\n  \\ table, but it might provide you with a helpful sanity check. You may use a similar\\\n  \\ code from lesson 5 (3.1), simply adapting it to your argument, or if you wish,\\\n  \\ write your own from scratch. The code from lesson 4 (2.2) may also be helpful.\\\n  \\ Whatever approach you take, you must clearly explain how the code works (as described\\\n  \\ below).\\n        2. As with any code, you need to include clearly annotated in-line\\\n  \\ comments to document what the code is doing and how it is using logic. Read [this\\\n  \\ resource](https://mikegrouchy.com/blog/yes-your-code-does-need-comments) about\\\n  \\ the importance of comments and [this one](https://realpython.com/python-comments-guide/)\\\n  \\ for further guidance.\\n        3. In addition to your brief in-line comments,\\\n  \\ you must also include an overarching explanation of what the code is doing as\\\n  \\ a whole in connection with #deduction. In particular, you should explain how the\\\n  \\ truth table is used to ascertain validity and how this logic concept is incorporated\\\n  \\ in the code (<150 words).\\n    2. _Optional challenge_: Write your own Python\\\n  \\ code that will create a truth table for any logical statement involving any number\\\n  \\ of atomic sentences and connectives. You can decide on the input/output format,\\\n  \\ but explain in detail what you are doing and why. In particular, be sure to explain\\\n  \\ why your work constitutes an effective application of #algorithms.\\n    3. _Optional\\\n  \\ super challenge_: Write your own Python code that will check the validity of any\\\n  \\ set of logical sentences that form an argument. Provide full explanation for how\\\n  \\ your code works. You can decide on the input/output format, but explain in detail\\\n  \\ what you are doing and why. Additionally, be sure to comment on why your work\\\n  \\ constitutes an effective application of #algorithms.\\n4. For the **fallacious\\\n  \\ argument** (<200 words):\\n    1. Name the type of fallacy or fallacies involved\\\n  \\ and justify the fallacious nature of the argument by explaining the flaw in logic.\\n\\\n  \\    2. Explain one way to mitigate this fallacy and describe the effect of the\\\n  \\ mitigation on the meaning of the conclusion and/or premises. (Translating this\\\n  \\ part of the argument into symbolic logic is not required but could be useful for\\\n  \\ your explanations.)\\n\\n\\u200B\\n\\n# **PART 2**\\n\\nFor the competing stance (Y),\\\n  \\ craft two brief arguments using **inductive reasoning** (please see the guidance\\\n  \\ provided above for how to construct your arguments from your chosen question).\\\n  \\ One argument should be a strong induction and one should contain a fallacy.\\n\\n\\\n  \\u200B\\n\\n**Analysis** [#induction, #fallacies]:\\n\\n1. Clearly identify the features\\\n  \\ of these arguments that make them inductive and explain why (<75 words).\\n2. For\\\n  \\ the strong induction (<200 words):\\n    1. Is this a specific type of induction?\\\n  \\ Which type, and why?\\n    2. Elaborate on the strength and reliability of the\\\n  \\ argument. Explain how the argument could be made more reliable (including by increasing\\\n  \\ the strength).\\n3. For the fallacious argument (<200 words):\\n    1. Name the\\\n  \\ type of fallacy or fallacies involved and justify the fallacious nature of the\\\n  \\ argument by explaining the flaw in logic.\\n    2. Explain one way to mitigate\\\n  \\ this fallacy and describe the effect of the mitigation on the meaning of the conclusion\\\n  \\ and/or premises.\\n\\n\\u200B\\n\\n# **REFLECTION**\\n\\nWrite a reflection about how\\\n  \\ you approached this assignment and what you learned. Address the following points.\\\n  \\ [#scienceoflearning]\\n\\n- While working on this assignment, how did the principles\\\n  \\ from the science of learning deepen your knowledge of #induction, #deduction,\\\n  \\ #algorithms, and #fallacies while working on this assignment?

Assignments will be weighted relative to HC-scored class polls and activities based on the values shown in the table below. All assessments will be scored based on the quality of HC application. For more information, see the \u201cAssessment\u201d section in the policies below.\n\n- **HC-scored Class Polls and Activities**: Each 90-minute class session will be taught on Forum. During each class, students will answer a preparatory assessment poll and a reflection poll, which occur at the beginning and end of class respectively. These polls may be HC scored. In addition, some class activities will be selected for video scoring. Students will be alerted to scored activities when scores on polls and activities are released.\n- **Signature Assignments:** These are original works (e.g., essays, short papers, problem sets or models) that consolidate the student\u2019s work on a combined set of HCs. The work is graded against a mandatory set of HCs that must be addressed. In addition, the student may address other HCs introduced earlier in this, or any other, Cornerstone course.\n- **Location-based Assignment:** All Minerva courses include a location-based assignment (LBA). Each location-based assignment involves engaging in an activity in the student\u2019s current city of residence, and targets application of HCs in a new, real-world, context. LBAs are estimated to require at least 5 hours with your city of residence, as well as additional time for preparation, research, and writing up the work product to submit. We understand that in the current public health crisis the ability to engage with locations will vary by student, and will ensure that all students are given the opportunity to excel in their LBA.\n- **Cornerstone Civic Project:** Each semester, students complete a single civic project across all four cornerstone classes. Cornerstone Civic Projects are described more toward the end of the syllabus and will appear as a separate course on Forum.\n",

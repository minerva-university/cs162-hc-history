        "details": "An algorithm defines a set of steps that lead a given input to produce the desired output. The steps of a proper algorithm are well-ordered, clear, unambiguous, and effective (doable). Additionally, the algorithm should be robust enough to handle a range of inputs, rather than a small set of specific cases. It should also be as simple and efficient as possible, avoiding redundancies. Lastly, a proper algorithm should terminate in a finite number of steps. These properties can be achieved by systematically incorporating conditional steps (in which a decision must be made) and iteration (repeated steps), usually requiring careful testing and troubleshooting (\u201cdebugging\u201d). Familiarity with various algorithmic strategies, such as brute-force methods, greedy algorithms, and divide-and-conquer approaches, can certainly broaden one\u2019s problem-solving repertoire. These algorithmic strategies can be used to efficiently solve many real\u00ad-world problems, from connecting individuals on social media, to controlling self\u00ad-driving cars, to sequencing DNA. Algorithms are the most powerful when they can be interpreted and run by computers. Thus, writing and explaining computer code helps to boost one\u2019s algorithmic thinking and problem-solving capabilities.",

Although such reasoning has limitations, analogies nevertheless can be invaluable in reasoning and problem solving. For example, once a problem has been solved, key elements of the solution can be abstracted and applied to solve other analogous problems using strategies such as reverse engineering.

Cognitive biases and emotional states can affect what we notice (or do not notice) and therefore influence our memories and decision making in various ways.

In particular, we tend to seek out information that confirms or is consistent with our prior beliefs, disregard information that is contrary to them, and interpret equivocal information as supporting our beliefs.

These groups provide a comparison case for a result, giving the researcher more confidence that the independent variable of interest is having a measurable effect (or not) on the dependent variable. In most cases, one or more of the comparison groups should be a control group. Control groups are not subject to the independent variable or treatment of interest and are instead used as a baseline comparison and to identify the effect of extraneous variables (e.g., placebo treatment in a drug trial). Without an appropriate control group, results may be misleading or incomplete. Many studies use alternative comparison groups in addition to control groups. Comparison groups are also used when it is not possible to have a true control group. Alternative comparison groups test the effect of the independent variable in different ways (e.g., different doses of the same drug for one group of subjects vs. another or different levels of acidity in one part of the ocean compared to another). Choosing appropriate comparison groups can be difficult, therefore one must be able to identify the limitations of a particular comparison group and interpret the results accordingly. The goal is to create comparisons that evaluate the hypothesis while eliminating alternative interpretations.",

        "details": "As individuals, humans have been described as having a \u201cherd instinct,\u201d leading each of us to want to do what others are doing or what we think is expected of us. Human societies tend to develop norms - broad patterns of behaviors that operate as taken-for-granted rules for behaviors, the violation of which is frowned upon and often punished by social means (such as ostracism or naming and shaming). Social norms play an important role in a functioning society, though there will be cultural variation between societies. Though social norms are human creation, existing in the minds of people as perception of prevalent or appropriate behavior, they are persistent and self-reinforcing as individual deviations are seen as violations to be reproached or exceptions that prove the rule. And yet, social norms are regularly challenged at the margins, and they evolve, change, and are overthrown over time. Norm entrepreneurs are constantly organizing to make their convictions accepted as taken-for-granted default behaviors and they apply a variety of long-term strategies that are often called \u201ctheories of change.\u201d Social change requires organizing because individuals can\u2019t unilaterally change norms. However, as individuals, we should identify and be aware of norms and make choices about the extent to which we follow them. Conformity to the behavior of others or to social norms has benefits and is sometimes appropriate but it could also undermine creativity and effective problem-solving. Much research indicates that a \u201ccontrarian\u201d perspective (going against the herd) can be an effective method for identifying new solutions and achieving goals. Yet contrarianism can sometimes be disruptive to the point of undermining progress. Learning to identify situations that invite conformity and determining when a contrarian approach is appropriate can help balance the impulse to \u201cgo along to get along.\u201d",

        "details": "Correlation is a statistical relationship that describes the degree to which two variables are associated. It\u2019s often used to estimate how likely two events or characteristics are to occur together, which can be used to predict one variable in terms of the other. However, care must be taken to apply and interpret correlation appropriately. In particular, correlation does not indicate that one event or characteristic causes the other: Both can be caused by a third event or characteristic or can be merely coincidental. There are several different ways to measure correlation, depending on the types of variables involved. One common measurement is Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (\ufeffr\ufeff), which quantifies the strength of the linear relationship between quantitative bivariate data.",

There are several types of distributions, but the most commonly used in statistics is the familiar bell curve, called a \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cgaussian\u201d distribution. When distributions are used to describe data, one must distinguish between population data (all possible values or elements of interest) and sample data (a subset of the population). Drawing statistical inferences about a population from sample data often requires a \u201csampling distribution,\u201d a theoretical distribution of the values of a specified statistic (i.e., mean, proportion) over all possible random samples of a specific size that can be made from a given population. The shape of the sampling distribution is ensured by the Central Limit Theorem when certain criteria are met. However, statistical analyses often require assumptions about the underlying distributions, requiring one to state those assumptions and analyze their limitations. Considering distributions can help one recognize phenomena such as regression to the mean.",

Other system-level properties are not easily understood as the sum of the properties of each part, due to the interactions between the parts: the total learning gained by Minerva students each year is not the sum of the each student\u2019s capacity for learning because interactions (e.g., discussion and joint activities) lead to additional learning. Emergent properties can usually, in principle, be analyzed and predicted in terms of the properties and interactions of the parts in a system; in practice, there are often limits to our ability to know and think about all parts and interactions, and so thinking in terms of the emergent property itself can be useful as well. Emergent properties typically occur at a higher level of analysis, and so emergent properties are macro-level properties.",

To act ethically, we must first recognize the ethical dimensions of our actions, and that, in turn, may involve identifying relevant ethical values or theories and explaining how they apply to the situation at hand. Ethical values define core commitments that form the foundation of an ethical outlook, which ascribe value to ideas like equality, freedom, life, security, happiness, privacy, and so forth. A commitment to ethical values gives rise to ethical considerations that may include, for example, people\u2019s rights, duties, welfare, intentions, or inclinations. Ethical theories account for hierarchies of values and ways to determine what we ought to do, given those values, also known as principles. Such theories include, for example, deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, care ethics, Buddhist ethics, Confucianism, and so on. Ethical theories could be useful to draw on when articulating ethical considerations though it is not necessary to have a complete theory in order to articulate and justify ethical considerations.",

There are numerous common flawed patterns of reasoning, typically grouped into two large classes: formal fallacies and informal fallacies. Formal fallacies result from errors in an argument\u2019s structure, while informal fallacies contain issues with the content of the propositions in an argument. One can learn to identify and correct the most common sorts of logical fallacies in both inductive and deductive reasoning.",

Formally, a \u201cgame\u201d involves agents (\u201cplayers\u201d), the actions each agent can take (\u201cstrategies\u201d), and the \u201cpayoffs\u201d for each agent for the various outcomes of the game. The payoffs for a given player depend not only on their own choice of strategy, but also on the actions of other players. An important part of evaluating a game is determining the strategy profiles that lead to an equilibrium, in which no player benefits by unilaterally changing their strategy. Under certain assumptions about the rationality of the players and the information they have access to, these equilibrium strategy sets can be used to predict the outcome of the game, thus providing applications in wide-ranging contexts, such as war, traffic flow, ecology, and marketing.",

Heuristics do not guarantee correct or useful solutions, but can often be efficient and effective tools when time and information are limited.

        "details": "Leadership involves intentionally influencing a group\u2019s behavior, identity, or beliefs\u2013which means that leadership always entails the exercise of power. Leaders are primarily judged on whether they are effective in realizing a group\u2019s overarching goal, which requires both flexibility in the face of fluid conditions and tenacity when opportunities appear. Leaders are thus often required or expected to set aside adherence to general rules and norms that apply to group members. At the same time, leaders are also judged on how well they articulate and embody their group\u2019s identity and core values. If they disregard these, they risk undermining the group\u2019s cohesion and their own credibility. Importantly, history teaches that almost all of a leader\u2019s shortcomings will be forgiven if they realize their group\u2019s objectives. A central challenge of leadership thus consists in actually achieving a group\u2019s goals, however ambitious, without undermining the group\u2019s identity or values. Applications of effective leadership address this challenge by providing descriptors for leadership approaches, standards for evaluating leadership effectiveness, and broad guidelines for building leadership approaches in complex conditions.",

        "details": "To understand and explain the characteristics and behavior of complex systems, one may conduct their research on different scales, or levels of analysis. For many of the questions we\u2019re interested in, an explanation that is situated on one level of analysis may be insufficient on its own to address the explanatory challenge, and a multilevel analysis is necessary. For example, in trying to figure out why students of a particular course aren\u2019t as engaged one may examine the individual students and their personalities but that investigation will be incomplete without also studying the academic culture of the students\u2019 class and even of the institution as a whole. One useful way to demonstrate the value of multi-level analysis is to pay attention to the ways in which phenomena on one level of analysis affect or shape outcomes in other levels. Analysis on multiple levels would often, but not always, require different disciplinary approaches, which provide different tools for conceptualizing components.",

Linguistic mediums, such as poetry or nonfiction, utilize different characteristics of language to meet their expressive goals. Other mediums, including music and visual art, communicate in ways that are fundamentally different from linguistic communication. Some such works are abstract, and others use recognizable symbols or familiar images to represent something deeper for the audience. Additionally, because a medium may encompass a number of different genres, authors may apply different genre-specific techniques and characteristics to make the work more vivid and memorable. To draw inferences about a particular medium, one needs to understand the relevant norms of expression and acquire the vocabulary to describe, analyze, and organize them.",

One can vary the nature of inputs to a model and the specific constraints on its behavior and then observe how the model behaves\u2014thereby deriving new predictions for how the phenomena in question should change when subjected to those inputs and constraints. Simulations are employed for this purpose and are especially useful when the implications of the model cannot easily be derived analytically.

For example, analysis of these networks can help us understand how ideas, resources, information, or diseases propagate through a social system. Network analysis begins with an explicit definition of the nodes in the network and the criteria for determining which nodes are connected by edges. Of particular interest are social networks, where nodes represent individuals. In this context, edges might represent friendship, communication, physical proximity, authority, or some other relevant social relationship. Analyzing network structures can help illuminate phenomena that cannot be explained by relying on the characteristics of individuals. A student may be the most influential trendsetter of their class not because they are the most innovative, outgoing or charismatic - but simply because of their location in the network of connections. If the structure of the network would change, because other students have formed new relationships, the trendsetter may lose their position of influence. Such a phenomenon is called a network effect.",

One key strategy employed in biology is teleological or adaptationist thinking, where we posit that a trait serves some function that benefits the organism\u2019s survival and reproduction. This type of reasoning can help us to understand why some mechanisms function as they do, and it can help us to generate testable hypotheses. However, we need to be cautious when applying adaptationist reasoning, as many traits may exist due to historical accident or as a byproduct of selection for some other trait. Similarly, some traits that are the direct products of natural selection may be serving some purpose different from simple survival and reproduction of the individual organism. A second important element of evolutionary reasoning is phylogenetic thinking. Genes and traits present in contemporary organisms are mostly derived from genes and traits that were present in some form in the common ancestor of multiple species. This shared history, structure, and function is what makes it possible to use studies on model organisms to gain insight into other species, and the changes from that ancestral state can shed light on contemporary function.",

This is a complex and challenging task, as many traits are the result of interactions among multiple genes and various environmental factors. Approaches include QTL mapping (e.g., by crossing inbred lines differing in the trait of interest) and association studies (e.g., GWAS), which look at correlations between the trait and standing variation in the population. Tools include genotyping, which classifies individuals based on their type at sites known to vary in the population, and sequencing, which is costlier, but may identify previously unknown variants. In some model organisms, it is also possible to directly manipulate particular locations in the genome and observe the phenotypic consequences.",

        "details": "Cells employ various mechanisms to regulate the level of proteins and other gene products. Regulation occurs throughout the entire process, from the initiation of transcription to the longevity or activity of gene products. In eukaryotes, alternative splicing allows a single gene to produce multiple distinct products. Gene expression regulation enables genetically identical cells to have distinct functions across different cell types, developmental stages, and environmental conditions. Regulation is often combinatorial, with a variety of cis-acting and trans-acting factors interacting to yield a particular expression pattern using both positive and negative control mechanisms.",

        "description": "Analyze patterns of inheritance to determine the underlying genetic and environmental basis of phenotypic trait variation",
        "details": "Observable phenotypes are the result of patterns of interactions among the alleles at different genetic loci and environmental factors. One element of genetic architecture is dominance, or how different combinations of alleles at a single locus affect the phenotype. Loss-of-function mutations are often recessive, but there are also cases of haploinsufficiency, as well as other types of mutations, which can result in other, more complex, dominance patterns. Epistasis refers to non-additive interactions among alleles at different loci, while pleiotropy is the phenomenon where variation at a single locus affects more than one \u201ctrait.\u201d Patterns of dominance, epistasis, and pleiotropy can suggest particular relationships at the molecular level (such as the order in which gene products act in a biochemical pathway). Most phenotypes are also affected by environmental variation. Genotype-by-environment (GxE) interaction occurs when genetic and environmental variants combine with non-linear effects on the phenotype. The study of GxE interactions can be complicated by GxE association, where genotypes are not randomly assorted into different environments. One common measure of the importance of genetic variation in determining phenotypic variation is the \u201cheritability.\u201d However, it is important to keep in mind that measures of heritability depend on the extent of both genetic and environmental variability, and are therefore only meaningful within that particular context.",

When designing or evaluating a study, the underlying research question and the unique features of different study populations will guide the choice of appropriate subjects and interpretation of results. Study populations can be considered at different levels of biological organization. For instance, at the cellular level, you may want to compare levels of expression of a gene in a metabolic pathway in different cell types. The study population for such a study might be kidney and liver cells. At the population level, you may compare populations with a high vs. low prevalence of a condition, or select a family pedigree with a known history of a syndrome. At the species level, model organisms have the potential to illuminate mechanisms and principles that may not be tractable in humans. For instance, much of what is known about eukaryotic gene regulation was studied in yeast. But if your ultimate goal is understanding human biology, you need to consider trade-offs between the ease of working with the model organism and the ability to generalize to humans. You also want to include practical considerations, such as the existence of well developed tools for working with the system, the organism\u2019s generation time, and the cost of maintaining or accessing a population of sufficient size to answer your question.",

Formally, optimization is the process of determining the relevant local or global extrema within a set of solutions that satisfy the problem constraints. To clearly define an optimization problem, one must identify the quantity to be minimized or maximized and the variables that can be modified or changed in search of the optimal value(s). Once the problem is defined, an appropriate optimization process or technique that describes how to achieve the optimal solution must be chosen. Many common optimization techniques can be implemented algorithmically. It is important to define a process that will yield a feasible solution that can be reasonably implemented.",

The posterior probability is updated as new data are obtained.

To communicate effectively, consider the norms for presenting yourself to others, including tone, forms of address, and the use of slang or informal speech. Always proofread written work for errors, properly attribute quotations, ideas, data and other sources, and follow conventional practices regarding attribution and formatting for the type of communication you are crafting. Different academic disciplines have different formatting conventions, and it is important to use the expected standards. More broadly, ensure that your approach to communication, whether verbal or written, meets or surpasses the expectations relevant to the context.",

        "details": "Within social systems, each human is a complex agent with behavior stemming from interactions between factors on multiple levels of analysis. These levels range from overarching (such as environmental, cultural, and social) to individual (such as biology, personality, beliefs, cognitions, and experience). Thus, interacting with complex social systems requires understanding multiple aspects of human psychology at multiple levels of explanation, how they interact, and how they give rise to emergent properties. Psychological theories that explain human behavior can thus examine interactions between genes and the environment, rational thoughts, unconscious biases, emotions, biological drives, internalized social norms, and cultural beliefs (among other factors). Applications of this HC use psychological theories or principles to explain human behavior and generate insights about individuals, groups, and even complex societies.",

        "details": "Regression is a statistical method that allows one to estimate the average value of the dependent (or \u201cresponse\u201d) variable conditional on one or more independent (or \u201cpredictor\u201d) variables. A regression function is formulated for this purpose and represents a model for the relationship between the variables. The strength of the relationship (the extent to which the model can be used for prediction) is quantified by the coefficient of determination, more commonly known as R-squared. This quantity indicates how much of the variability in the dependent variable can be explained by the regression model. Multiple regression enables one to make predictions about the response variable conditional on values of more than one predictor variable, and make inferences about the relationship between a single predictor and the outcome variable when holding all other predictors constant. Regression analyses are most often used to make predictions and to classify or categorize information, but one should be cautious about using regression to infer causal relationships.",

This means that one should contribute according to one\u2019s abilities and ethical principles, keeping in mind not to set unrealistic expectations. After carefully setting expectations, it is crucial to think about accountability structures. To act responsibly, it is vital to recognize what is and is not within your locus of control. One can improve one\u2019s self-control and grit to an extent, which will help set and achieve ambitious goals, but it is important to recognize the limits of individual effort too. When setbacks arise, it is crucial to acknowledge your responsibility for areas where you have fallen short and to be proactive about finding solutions. Others should be told about problems with enough advance notice for them to adjust their plans and deal with the resulting challenges.",

We divide the tools for shaping behaviors into three categories, each with distinct strengths and weaknesses: (dis)incentives, reward/punishment, and choice architecture. \n\nIncentives and disincentives change agents\u2019 behavior by altering the expected utility payoff of the choices they face. Thus, incentives and disincentives rely on the model of rational agents who aim to maximize their expected utility and operate as promises (of reward) and threats (of punishment), aiming to encourage or discourage a behavior before it takes place. (Dis)incentives are successful if they motivate agents to engage or avoid certain behaviors. \n\nIn contrast, rewards and punishments are administered after an action. Rewards and punishments aim to teach agents what behaviors lead to better and worse results, and they are successful when agents are more likely to engage in the rewarded behavior and less likely to engage in a punished one. \n\nChoice architecture influences behavior by manipulating the way options are presented. It uses psychological influence that \u2018nudges\u2019 humans separately from their utility calculations without altering the available choices.

Setting up, executing, and interpreting the results of significance tests requires one to identify and contemplate the unavoidable statistical errors that are possible. Statistical significance, however, says nothing about whether the size of the difference or pattern matters practically. That is the domain of practical significance, which is evaluated by measuring the effect size. One must take care to distinguish these two very different concepts, using appropriate calculations and interpretations.",

        "details": "Complex systems change over time. Phase spaces can be used to describe and predict these changes, providing the foundation for planning interventions. The dimensions of a phase space (similar to axes on a graph) describe measurable features of the system that can increase or decrease over time. Attractors are locations on the phase space that represent stable equilibria: a system at that combination of values on the dimensions is likely to stay at that combination. Attractors can be described as surrounded by basins of attraction, representing a range of values on the dimensions that are likely to move towards the attractor in the basin. This implies critical points at the edges of each basin: a system is unlikely to move to a specific attractor unless it reaches a critical point on the boundary of that attractor\u2019s basin, but if it does pass that critical point then it is likely to move to the attractor.",

Just like a map can represent a geographical reality by distinguishing topographical or political features, the way we dissect any particular system depends on, and should be guided by, the purpose of inquiry, which in empirical research is the explanatory challenge we face. Complex systems can be deconstructed in a variety of ways that define both the scope of the system as well as the relevant attributes of its components (in social systems, most commonly, people). Thus, the key part of deconstructing a system is conceptualizing its constituent parts in several ways in order to choose or synthesize the \u2018mapping\u2019 of the system that is most appropriate for addressing the explanatory challenge. For example, in analyzing a football team one might think of players in terms of their position on the field, their running speed or their personality types. Depending on the question at hand, one may or may not include the players\u2019 personal trainers, the team\u2019s management or even the fans. One specific application of this concept is considering organizational structure: there are various ways in which the same group of people and functions may be related to one another, such as a strict hierarchy, a matrix or a flat structure.",

        "description": "Use utility to represent preferences and analyze purposeful decision-making. (C) FA",
        "details": "Lying at the heart of decision theory is the concept of utility, an abstraction that represents the amount of satisfaction an individual derives from an outcome. If we assume that decision-making is purposeful action aimed at realizing pre-existing preferences, we can use the concept of utility to formalize the content of these preferences and relate them to outcomes. Specifically, a utility function serves as a mathematical model that describes one\u2019s preferences by mapping the value of outcomes (e.g. time, money) to a particular individual\u2019s derived satisfaction by attaching a value to each of the possible outcomes. The most common applications of utility hinge on an assumption that agents are rational, meaning that their utility function adheres to certain properties (e.g., consistency, transitivity). In the context of decision making, agents are typically thought of as utility maximizers. This means that when sufficient information is available to quantify outcomes and corresponding probabilities, a decision maker will choose the option with the maximal \u201cexpected utility,\u201d which is the probability-weighted average utility of an action. Personal characteristics, such as risk preferences and cognitive biases are represented by utility functions with different shapes and can further affect one\u2019s expected utility by skewing the perception of probabilities. Common tendencies to be aware of include risk-seeking and risk-averse attitudes, distorting probabilities, disproportionately weighting losses versus gains, and inconsistently valuing utilities over time. Evaluating utility, utility functions, and expected utilities can help one analyze decision-making scenarios from both an empirical and a normative perspective.",

        "details": "An important initial step in analyzing a problem, model, or system, is to evaluate the relevant variables: the features that can change. To do so, one must identify and classify the relevant variables, examine the relationships between them, and consider how they can be measured and manipulated. In the context of a study or experiment, this typically involves identifying which features play the role of independent variables, the hypothesized predictors, and which play the role of the dependent variable, the hypothesized response that results from changes in the independent variable(s). One may also need to identify confounding variables that could impact the relationship under study, and carefully consider how to mitigate their effects. Further, classifying the type of variables (for example, qualitative or quantitative) is essential as it will affect the type of statistical analyses that are appropriate. Representing a problem formally may also involve identifying the quantities that are constant (not varying), usually referred to as parameters. Parameters help to define the nature of the problem and can be treated as constraints on the solution.",

But the most sensible way to map this system is by market share, since the market is the system.

But that varies from region to region and within specific countries. You could also break down the global market according to growth regions – some have grown much faster than others. Or you could break down the global market simply by worth (size) of regional markets. In all cases you need to define the system more concretely, which is easily doable with research.

This is something to think about moving forward.

I also don't really see a connection between that hypothesis and the dataset. The first and third are workable, but again could have been better grounded with some connection to data. Why would being distracted change their perception of learning? Why would being comfortable and motivated change their perception of learning?

One point here is that what you are calling "purpose" here is closer to the concept of "relevance." That is, these are on a topic that is appropriate for your paper. 

"Purpose" is more about thinking about the agenda or motivation of the authors. Is there anything to make us suspect that they have some goal with their writing other than an objective description of the facts. For instance, if one of the authors was a native Ewe speaker, and they published a paper using a bunch of data to argue that Ewe should be adopted as the national language of Ghana, you might question if their identity could be influencing how the interpret and present the data.</td><td>4.0</td><td>sourcequality</td><td>108093</td><td>Thesis-driven Essay</td><td>99362</td><td>Multimodal Communications</td><td>AH50</td><td>AH</td><td>Arts and Humanities</td><td>1</td><td>Fall 2022</td><td>27</td><td>completed</td><td>2022-11-25T18:54:48Z</td></tr><tr><td>1889235</td><td>Overall, the organization is well done.

Your conclusion at the end does feel strong. However, you need to then take that conclusion and make sure the rest of the argument leads there.

A strong application of this HC requires (1) a concise list of the salient features common to both comparands (essentially, identifying the deep similarities despite the superficial differences), (2) an explanation of how the common features can serve as a bridge; and (3) a sketch of the proposed solution that indicates how the solution will address the novel problem or issue.

Good understanding is displayed in your explanation and your code. I'd like to see more about how the algorithm actually works. What are the steps?

------------------------------
Comment: 
The variables S, I, R are dependent variables. t is the independent variable. 

In the differential model, the variables S, I, and R are treated as quantitative continuous. During the numerical solution (simulation), all the variables are discretized and there they become discrete.

In the differential model, time is also defined as continuous. During the numerical solution (simulation), all the variables are discretized and there t becomes day, week, month or even hour/minute.

The parameter b is the infection rate. This parameter combines two effects: the rate at which S and I individuals interact and the probability that such an interaction will lead to an infection. More specifically, it is the average number of contacts between S and I per person per time, multiplied by the probability of disease transmission in such a contact. Its dimension is 1/time. If b = 1/x, this would mean that each infected person would make a possibly infecting contact once every x days, assuming our unit of time is days. Equivalently, you might say that each infected person has a ((1/x)*100)% chance of infecting a susceptible individual each day. A variety of different factors could cause a lower value of b, considering both the properties of the disease itself and the behavior of the individuals in the population: a less contagious disease, fewer social gatherings, more mask-wearing, more handwashing, more travel restrictions, etc. 

The parameter k is defined as the recovery rate; it captures how quickly an individual recovers from a disease. We see it being multiplied by the infected population (I) to signify that this is the rate at which individuals transition from being infected to recovered, or "removed." We can think of the parameter as being the reciprocal of the infectiousness period. Its dimension is 1/time. Thus, k = 1/x would indicate that the infectiousness period (the time it takes to recover) is x days, assuming we're working in units of days. Equivalently, we can also think of this as the fraction of the infected population that will recover on any given day. A larger value of k could result from a relatively mild disease that has a quick recovery period (small opportunity to infect others) or vice versa.</td><td>2.0</td><td>variables</td><td>109607</td><td>Algorithms and Simulation</td><td>108553</td><td>Formal Analyses</td><td>CS51</td><td>CS</td><td>Computational Sciences</td><td>3</td><td>Spring 2023</td><td>28</td><td>completed</td><td>2023-03-11T15:14:43Z</td></tr><tr><td>2002720</td><td></td><td>4.0</td><td>medium</td><td>109422</td><td>Interpreting Art</td><td>109188</td><td>Multimodal Communications</td><td>AH51</td><td>AH</td><td>Arts and Humanities</td><td>1</td><td>Spring 2023</td><td>28</td><td>completed</td><td>2023-03-18T21:24:18Z</td></tr><tr><td>2002722</td><td></td><td>4.0</td><td>professionalism</td><td>109434</td><td>Interpreting Art</td><td>109188</td><td>Multimodal Communications</td><td>AH51</td><td>AH</td><td>Arts and Humanities</td><td>1</td><td>Spring 2023</td><td>28</td><td>completed</td><td>2023-03-18T21:25:24Z</td></tr><tr><td>2002718</td><td>Good, clear slides -- the one major improvement could be to focus on the key terms of your analysis rather than just naming the elements or topics you are discussing.</td><td>3.0</td><td>communicationdesign</td><td>109385</td><td>Interpreting Art</td><td>109188</td><td>Multimodal Communications</td><td>AH51</td><td>AH</td><td>Arts and Humanities</td><td>1</td><td>Spring 2023</td><td>28</td><td>completed</td><td>2023-03-18T21:23:28Z</td></tr><tr><td>2002721</td><td>These are good steps to take, but make sure you include documentation of what changes you made, and, even better, detailed discussion of why those changes improve the design (for the audience, for your purpose, etc.).</td><td>3.0</td><td>designthinking</td><td>109400</td><td>Interpreting Art</td><td>109188</td><td>Multimodal Communications</td><td>AH51</td><td>AH</td><td>Arts and Humanities</td><td>1</td><td>Spring 2023</td><td>28</td><td>completed</td><td>2023-03-18T21:25:12Z</td></tr><tr><td>2002724</td><td>This HC can be helpful not only for basics of audibility and clarity, but also for finding ways to add emphasis or emotion to a presentation.

Then, be sure to tag a third LO that you want to be graded on. You are suggested to tag either #b111-financials or #b111-valuation, however, if you like, you can repeat #bizstrategy or #bizrisk. To increase the chance of earning 4's make sure you read the rubrics 3 and 4 and see the di erence between them. Tag your LOs wherever relevant (read the LOs to be Assessed below) and explain how you have used them in detail.
